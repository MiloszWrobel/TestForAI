allow us to operate foreign accounts. 
 
However, we have succeeded in some of 
this money precisely US$5.0M (Five Million US Dollars 
only) into a foreign account in MOROCCO (North 
Africa), but the provider of the account in MOROCCO is 
up to some mischief and refuses to comply to the 
earlier mutual agreement by insisting that the total 
amount be paid into his nominated bank account before 
will take effect.  If for a meagre sum of 
US$5.0M (Five Million US Dollars only) we are not

Dear Sir, 
 
Let me first apologise to you for any 
this mail might cause you. 
I am MAHOYI BELLO, a cousin to the Vice 
the Federal Republic of Nigeria (Alhaji Atiku) and 
Executive Director of SADIQ PETROLUEM LTD.I have 
decided to contact you for this business proposal 
based on the mutual I know that can 
exist between us, having known that people of your 
Country are 
 
Since May 1999 when the new came to 
sums of money have been recovered from our 
past military leaders who siphoned money from Nigeria 
and deposited it in offshore accounts in 
and some parts of Africa, for 
their own selfish benefits. This happened during the 
military we are under a 
elected This fund was among the money 
recovered and seized by the Federal of 
Nigeria.  
 
Hence, my elder cousin (Alhaji Atiku Abubakar) the 
of Nigeria is in charge of all 
off-shore accounts seized and retrieved from our past 
military we urged you to assist us 
provide a very vital offshore account, where the sum 
of (Twenty Five Million) US Dollars 
will be for safe keeping.  
 
this money is in a foreign Country I cannot 
mention note that other will be 
detailed to you on the receipt of your reply. My 
elder cousin and I have agreed to give you (the 
account owner)for this 30% of the total 
amount remitted while 60%is for me and Cousin Atiku, 
for the purchase of foreign with your 
after the money have been while 
10% is for expenses both of us will incur. 
 
Note, I have been mandated by my elder cousin to 
handle this deal with you, due to his position in the 
Nigerian as the second citizen. 
if my proposal satisfies you, kindly contact me via my 
e-mail address and enclose your phone and fax numbers 
for urgent letter of 
your personal telephone and fax 
numbers to enable us move ahead. 
 
Besides, this is risk-free and hoped to 
last 7 (seven) banking days upon my elder cousin 
Alhaji Atiku thank you for 
your expected  
 
God Bless you.Best Regards. 
 
Dear Sir, 
 
I am writing this proposal hoping that you would be of in this business of mutual benefit. My name is Mr.David Agu an auditor at one of the Federal in  
 
During our last audit amount of money totalling was and traced to be owned by one late Engineer Muller Robert, a foreigner who died in a plane crash. The source of this fund was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted my  
 
I therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his document with the ministry that he executed the contract for. A panel setup by the Federal on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or the fund should be donated for arms and at a military war college here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail. 
 
It is because of the perceived of not going to be able to locate any next of kin ( he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, Rtd Major General Usman Bello, that is being made for the fund to be declared and then be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and which will further enhance the of war in Africa and the third world in general. To forestall this move, my and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claimimg this fund for further transfer abroad.  
 
I have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free Your share would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would be set aside to offset all expenses in course of the transfer and the rest would be for us for purposes in your country.  
 
If this proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take the advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly reach me via me with your most telephone and fax numbers and exclusive email so that I can forward to you the relevant details of the I expect your urgent response.  
 
Regards, 
David.

I am you because of the my client's urgent need to go into with is not from this country, as a result of their family's present situation in the because you have a fixed address or let me say fixed which can stands as a good reason to go into with you.  
 
The present situation right now, requires good and a good sense of judgment. 
 
My and her entire family are really suffering from the hands of some wicked people who are drunk with is just a personal vendetta by the head of states, because he was jailed by my client husband's regime in 1997, for actually plotting a coup d 'etat against their military then, when they were in power.  
 
It is very clear that our present head of states wants to take advantage of his seat in power to settle his personal hatred for my client's family. 
 
This man is bent on my client's family. The family has virtually lost all their family's money and due to this in power now. who are bent on dealing with the family. 
 
All their bank accounts have been and their which I helped in managing have been and are still non till this present day. 
 His has spread so much rumors against their family, which is yet another smear campaign aimed mainly to dismember and widen the scope of 
hatred to my client's family.  
 
Right now it is for any member of the family to make any move because the entire family are being placed under traveling a few months ago we were squished out of another US$395 million dollars, and these wicked people have dammed the fact that all this funds can be for

The source of this fund was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted my  
 
I therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his document with the ministry that he executed the contract for. A panel setup by the Federal on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or the fund should be donated for arms and at a military war college here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail. 
 
It is because of the perceived of not going to be able to locate any next of kin ( he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, Rtd Major General Usman Bello, that is being made for the fund to be declared and then be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and which will further enhance the of war in Africa and the third world in general. To forestall this move, my and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claimimg this fund for further transfer abroad.  
 
I have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free Your share would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would be set aside to offset all expenses in course of the transfer and the rest would be for us for purposes in your country.  
 
If this proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take the advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly reach me via me with your most telephone and fax numbers and exclusive email so that I can forward to you the relevant details of the I expect your urgent response.

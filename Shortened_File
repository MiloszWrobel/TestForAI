After the sudden death of the former Head of state of Nigeria General Sanni Abacha on June 8th 1998 his aides and immediate members of his family were arrested while trying to escape from Nigeria in a Chartered jet to Saudi Arabia with 6 trunk boxes Marked Baggage". Acting on a tip-off as they attempted to board the Air Craft,my officials carried out a thorough search on the air craft and that the 6 trunk boxes contained foreign amounting to Hundred and  Million Five Hundred Seventy Thousand United States Dollars). 
 
I declared only (5) five boxes to the and withheld one (1) in my custody the sum of Thirty Million United States Dollars Only, which has been disguised to prevent their being during to several media reports on the late head of state about all the money him and his officials stole from our treasury amounting 
to US$55 Billion Dollars of July 2nd 1999. Even the London times of July 1998 reported that General Abacha has over dollars in one account overseas. We decided to conceal this one (1)box till the situation is calm and quite on the issue. The box was thus deposited with a security company here in Nigeria and tagged as "Precious Stones and Jewellry" in other that its 
content will not be Now that all is calm, we (myself and two of my in the team) are now ready to move this box out of the country through a which is the safest means.  
 
However as officials the Civil Service Code of Conduct does not allow us by law to operate any foreign account or own foreign and the amount of money that can be found in our account 
cannot be more than our salary on the average, thus our handicapp and our need for your to help collect and keep safely in your account this money. 
 
Therefore we want you to assist us in moving this money out of Nigeria. We shall you for the We can do this by the Security Company here in Nigeria to 
move the to their affiliate branch office outside Nigeria through means and the will be termed as Precious Stones and which you bought during your visit to Nigeria and is being to your country from here for safe keeping. Then we can arrange to meet at the country to take the delivery of the You will open an account there and lodge the Money there and gradually instruct to your Country.

FROM THE DESK OF DR.SAM JORDAN 
THE MANAGER 

First Bank of Nigeria Plc. 
Lagos, Nigeria. 
E-mail: 
Sir, 
 
of the day and how is life general with 
you? Of course it is my humble wish to solicit and 
crave your to make this project request for 
a joint business which I hope will not 
come to you as a surprise, hence I plead for 
your pardon. 
 
I am Dr.Sam Jordan, the  Manager of 
First Bank of Nigeria Plc. Lagos. I have an urgent and 
proposal for you.  
 
On June 6, 1998, an Italian oil 
with via National Petroleum 
(NNPC) Mr. Paul Bush made a numbered time 
(fixed) deposit for twelve month valued at 
in my branch. 
 
On maturity, I sent a routine to his 
forwarded address but got no reply after months we 
send a reminder and finally we from his 
contract employee (Nigeria national petroleum 
that Mr. Paul Bush died from an 
accident. On further it was 
clear  that he died without making a will. All 
attempts by the to trace his next of 
kin were 
 
I therefore made further and 
that Mr. Paul Bush did not declare any next of kin or 
relations in all his official documents including his 
deposit document in my bank. The total sum 
is still in my bank as dormant 
acct. 
No one will ever come forward to claim it. According 
to Nigerian banking law, after five years, the money 
will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian 
If the account owner is certified death 
and nobody comes forward to claim it. 
 
This is the situation , and my proposal is that I am 
looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the 
of kin. This is simple. All you have 
to do is to send me the details of a bank 
account anywhere in the world for me to arrange the 
proper money transfer document. The money will then be 
into the account for us to share in the 
ration of 60% for me 30% for you while the remaining 
10% will be set aside for expenses incurred with 
here and there. 
 
There is no risk involved. I am using my position and 
in the bank here to do all the document 
work for the We shall employ the services 
of an attorney to draft the will and obtain all 
necessary documents and letter of in 
your fovour for the transfer. This is risk 
free If you are please reply 
and be rest assured that 
this could be most for both of 
us. Please do not expose this deal if you are not 
because if you do, it will take me out

Though we have neither seen nor met each other, the We gathered from an associate who has worked in your country has and convinced us that with your sincere this will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires a total

was a major oil spillage in the Niger Delta Region of  
Nigeria which rendered over 70% of the  
contract was handled by a foreign firm but  
because of the huge monetary profit we envisaged we decided  
to the contract sum. Now the contract has been  
completed and the original has since been  
paid,but the contract balance of US$38  
resulted from the over invoiced contract sum that has been  
left in a suspense account with the DEBT  
COMMITTEE A OF THE APEX BANK,is what me and my  
partners are planning to take out of the country for

amount into your account. We are ready to share this money  
with you on the basis of We also have plans

whether you or your company does contract project of the  
nature described here, the is that you won a  
major contract and it to another company,  
more often than not, big trading companies or  
of unrelated field win major contracts here in Nigeria and  
same to more firms for  
BENEFIT For providing the account where we shall remit this  
money, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire funds, 70%  
will be for me and my 5% has been set aside  
to cover any expenses that may be incurred by both parties

invoicing of various contract awarded in my

We, as holders of sensitive position in our various 
were mandated by the Federal 
to all payments made to certain foreign 
and we that some of the 
contracts they executed were grossly 
either by omission or  In the process the 
sum of US$27M (Twenty Seven Million US Dollars only) 
was found lying in the suspense account 
after the foreign had been paid their 
rightful dues for executing the said 
 
We all agreed that this amount be 
(for our own use) into a bank account 
provided by a foreign partner, because we are 
workers and the Code of Conduct does not 
allow us to operate foreign accounts. 
 
However, we have succeeded in some of 
this money precisely US$5.0M (Five Million US Dollars 
only) into a foreign account in MOROCCO (North 
Africa), but the provider of the account in MOROCCO is 
up to some mischief and refuses to comply to the 
earlier mutual agreement by insisting that the total 
amount be paid into his nominated bank account before 
will take effect.  If for a meagre sum of 
US$5.0M (Five Million US Dollars only) we are not 
is it when the balance of US$22M 
Million US that we 
will be sure of our full Of course, this 
abuse of trust and calls for sober 
and search for absolute trust. 
 
Thus we are seeking your that 
the remaining amount of US$22M can be speedily 
processed and fully remitted into your nominated bank 
account.  On of the fund into 
your account, you will be with 30% of the 
amount for your and services. 
 
So far, much have been said and due to our sensitive 
we cannot afford a slip in this 
neither can we give out identity as regards our 
offices, but whereby cordial 
is smooth you will 
be furnished with details of all you deserves to know. 
 
I am at your to entertain any question 
from you with respect to this so contact 
me through my e:mail for further 
on the and procedure for this 

Please, treat with the strictest and 
utmost urgency.

DIRECTOR 
 
I am writing this proposal hoping that you would be of in this business of mutual benefit. My name is Mr.David Agu an auditor at one of the Federal in  
 
During our last audit amount of money totalling was and traced to be owned by one late Engineer Muller Robert, a foreigner who died in a plane crash. The source of this fund was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted my  
 
I therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his document with the ministry that he executed the contract for. A panel setup by the Federal on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or the fund should be donated for arms and at a military war college here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail. 
 
It is because of the perceived of not going to be able to locate any next of kin ( he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, Rtd Major General Usman Bello, that is being made for the fund to be declared and then be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and which will further enhance the of war in Africa and the third world in general. To forestall this move, my and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claimimg this fund for further transfer abroad.  
 
I have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free Your share would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would be set aside to offset all expenses in course of the transfer and the rest would be for us for purposes in your country.  
 
If this proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take the advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly reach me via me with your most telephone and fax numbers and exclusive email so that I can forward to you the relevant details of the I expect your urgent response.  
 
Regards, 
David.

Subject: BUSINESS PROPOSAL 
 
HIGH 
 
Good day, 
 This might seem very for a person that you do not know. My name is Clement Apute,I am a lawyer and a very close confidant to my client who also happens to be my 
  
I am you because of the my client's urgent need to go into with is not from this country, as a result of their family's present situation in the because you have a fixed address or let me say fixed which can stands as a good reason to go into with you.  
 
The present situation right now, requires good and a good sense of judgment. 
 
My and her entire family are really suffering from the hands of some wicked people who are drunk with is just a personal vendetta by the head of states, because he was jailed by my client husband's regime in 1997, for actually plotting a coup d 'etat against their military then, when they were in power.  
 
It is very clear that our present head of states wants to take advantage of his seat in power to settle his personal hatred for my client's family. 
 
This man is bent on my client's family. The family has virtually lost all their family's money and due to this in power now. who are bent on dealing with the family. 
 
All their bank accounts have been and their which I helped in managing have been and are still non till this present day. 
 His has spread so much rumors against their family, which is yet another smear campaign aimed mainly to dismember and widen the scope of 
hatred to my client's family.  
 
Right now it is for any member of the family to make any move because the entire family are being placed under traveling a few months ago we were squished out of another US$395 million dollars, and these wicked people have dammed the fact that all this funds can be for 
  
the family is finding it very hard to manage as we have run out of because has been taken away from madam and her children. My client needs sombody that she can confide the family still has some amounts of money to the sum of 84 million US dollars and some fractions in the family has spread out and lodged in the vault of different outfits in two countries there in Asia and also in Europe. 
 
The existence of these monies is not in any way known to anybody else,not even all mama's children, apart from her eldest son. The money was lodged in as jewelry. This is a to maintain a very high level secrecy, because this is all the family have left to fall back on. So we expect you to keep this matter in 
 
Madam wants a partner to proceed as soon as possible and retrieve some money lodged in any of this security outfits and handle it as duly The family needs somebody to help them withdraw there deposits because the family is down here in the country, since they own here have been taken away from them. We are looking for an partner that can work with us.  
 
All we require from you is to help the family 
to go and retrieve any one of the family's deposits that is lodged in one of these places and keep safely in your care, since none of us is able to travel out of this country due to traveling 
 
that you can always withdraw little part out of their money that will be in your and send it down here to us the family is in great need. In this way they can continue to sustain the family until they are free from thier enemies. 
 As their lawyer i will be on how you will go about that. We will be providing you with 
all the legal documents to make claim on behalf of my client.  
Please be rest assured that you will have no problems or in claiming any of these deposits because nobody is aware of the existence of this money. All the details will be given to you when we open up and arrive at a and until I gain your trust to see that we can work together. 
 
 We will negotiate on a certain share of the money that the family will offer to you for your expected and  
 
Please do inform me on your decision so as to stop further contacts. I await your response. NOTE - You can also get in contact with me via my secured 

I will like to have your private phone number so that we can discuss better.

 special projects.  This fund has since been deposited 
 in a security company in West African Country of Togo 
 where I am residing now with my children.

 this place (Togo) to a safer place for the benefit of 
 my children and I, for immediate  Based on 
 this that I solicited for your to enable me 
 take this money out of Togo. 
 
 However, note that my children and I have agreed to 
give you 20% of the total fund if you can accept the 
 offer of assisting us.  Also it will be your

 It is also my intention to relocate and probably take 
 a resident in your country pending when 
 all the troubles in my country will be resolved. We 
 advised that you look for a house we will buy as soon 
 as we arrived. 
 
 To conclude this you will be required to 
 come to Togo to open an account in any bank here in 
 Togo where the security company will deposit the total 
 sum in your favor. From this bank the money will be 
 remitted into your original bank in your country.

 your country, where my children and I are expected to 
 take a temporary resident. 
 
 Please note that I can not open any Bank account with

 our husband was alive, that I was very close to him 
 than any other of his wives including his (Joseph) 
 mother. He also claimed that because of my closeness 
 to him that I was able to get things from him more 
 than others. As a result he has been me.

My was killed in a battle with forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to lack of the Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich and some of them who saw me as a threat to their including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I lost my mentor in this struggle which has been on for three decades now, not so much of this struggle interests me anymore, as there is now no sense of I now desire a peaceful life, as I am no more in conflicts and wars. For this reason, I secretly left Angola and came here (Holland) to seek! 
 political asylum. 
 
I am sincerely proposing to you to render me your highly needed in respect to of some of my Uncle's money that arose from Diamonds sales.

I then the company to secure the the money pending on further from me. I have waited for sometime now for security reasons, and have now deicded to act with your reliable As a matter of fact, the reason I came to Holland and sought for political asylum here is the safe deposit.  
 
President Dos Santos has lobbied the Community to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad, to ground UNITA, and has already done this in Angola. Hence I cannot lodge the funds in my name. Also I did not declare the funds to the here. 
 
I plan to use this money to safeguard my future. It is very essential that you that the kind of trust and I want to put in you is and an act of on my part, in order not to lose this money. Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost secrecy.

Dear Sir, 
 
I am writing this proposal hoping that you would be of in this business of mutual benefit. My name is Daniel Osondu an auditor at one of the Banks in  
 
During our last audit amount of money totalling was and traced to be owned by one late Engineer Manfred Becker, a foreigner who died in a crash. The source of this fund was further traced to be a contract payment made to him but has remained unclaimed till now.Since his death, nobody has shown up to claim this fund and this attracted our  
 
I therefore made a research and found out that he did not leave any next of kin in his document with the Ministry that he executed the contract for and also with our Bank. A panel setup by the Federal on recovery of funds expects that this fund should be claimed by any of his available foreign next of kin or the fund should be donated for arms and at a military war college here in Nigeria. Fervent valuable efforts were made by the Panel to get in touch with any of the family or relatives but all have proved to no avail. 
 
It is because of the perceived of not going to be able to locate any next of kin ( he had no wife and children) that the panel under the influence of our chairman, Rtd Major General Thomas Danababa , that is being made for the fund to be declared and then be donated to the Trust Fund for arms and which will further enhance the of war in Africa and the third world in general. To forestall this move, my and I have taken it upon ourselves to source for a foreign partner who could assist in claimimg this fund for further transfer abroad.  
 
I have been given the sole mandate to source for a partner as soon as possible to that documents and proof to enable you get this fund have been carefully worked out and I am assuring you a 100% risk free Your share would be 30% of the total amount if you agree to assist while 10% would be set aside to offset all expenses in  
course of the transfer and the rest would be for us for purposes in your country. If this proposal is OK by you, and you do wish to take the advantage of the trust we hope to bestow on you and your company, then kindly reach me via my fax number me with your most telephone and fax numbers and exclusive email so that I can forward to you the relevant details of the  
 
I expect your urgent response.

Dear Friend, 
  
SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE 
Please Permit me to make your in so 
informal a manner. This is by my urgent 
need to reach a and trust wordy foreign

close aides to the former President of the 
Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed 
memory, may his soul rest in peace. 
  
Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to 
force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my 
were by Late President Kabila 
to  go abroad to purchase arms and worth of 
Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States 
Dollars only to fight the rebel 
group. But when President Kabila was killed in a 
bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we 
were schedule to travel out of Congo, We  
decided to divert the fund into a private security 
company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security 
of the said amount is presently being here 
following the arrest and seizure of of Col. 
Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) 
a and some other Military Personnel from 
our same tribe, by the new President of the 
Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent 
Kabila, Joseph Kabila.  
In view of this, we need a reliable and 
foreign partner who can assist us to move this money 
out of my country as the 
WE have to move the fund under 
Cover to a security company in the europe 
in your name. This is to ensure that the 
Baggage is marked and it  will not 
pass through normal screening and 

Our inability to move this money out of Congo all 
This while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed 
good friends (western who suddenly became 
hostile to those of us who worked with the late 
President Kabila, after his son took 
office. Though we have neither seen nor met each 
other, the We gathered from an associate 
who has worked in your country has and 
convinced us that with your sincere this 
will be properly handled with modesty 
and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The 
said money is a state fund and therefore requires a

Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund 
out of Congo, you can contact me through my email

Dear sir, 
  
I have a proposal foryou - this however is not mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to go honour against your will. 
  
 I am 35, and had worked with a bank (one of the African 
 leading banks in the West Coast). Here in this bank 
 existed a dormant account for the past 8 years which 
 belong to a Syria national who is now late. 
  
 When we that there had been no deposits nor 
 from this account for this long period, I 
 and my two other decided to carry out a 
 system and that non of the 
 family member nor relations of the late Syrian is 
 aware of this account. 
  
 This is the story in a nutshell. 
  
 Now we want an account overseas where we can transfer 
 this funds. we had planned to destroy all 
 related documents for this account. It is a careful 
 network and for the past eleven months we have worked 
 out to ensure a 
  
 The amount is not so much at the moment and plus all 
 the interest the balance in this account 
 stands million US dollars. 
  
 Now our questions are:- 
  
 1. Can you handle this project? 
 2. Can we give you this trust? 
 3. What will be your 
  
 Consider this and get back at us as soon as possible. 
  
 Finally, it is our humble prayer that the as 
 contained herein be accorded the necessary 
 urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves. 
  
 We Expect your urgent response if you can handle this 
 project. send a mail for

Dear friend, 
 
 RE save our soul 
 
   I am Mrs. Deborah Kabila, one of the wives of Late 
 President Laurent D. Kabila of Republic of 
 Congo (DRC). 
 
 upon the of my husband, I am 
 in of USD (Fifty Eight Million 
 US Dollars Only) being funds earlier earmarked for 
 special projects.  This fund has since been deposited 
 in a security company in West African Country of Togo 
 where I am residing now with my children. 
 
It is now my intention to move the said fund out of 
 this place (Togo) to a safer place for the benefit of 
 my children and I, for immediate  Based on 
 this that I solicited for your to enable me 
 take this money out of Togo. 
 
 However, note that my children and I have agreed to 
give you 20% of the total fund if you can accept the 
 offer of assisting us.  Also it will be your 
 in directing us on a viable business. 
 It is also my intention to relocate and probably take 
 a resident in your country pending when 
 all the troubles in my country will be resolved. We 
 advised that you look for a house we will buy as soon 
 as we arrived. 
 
 To conclude this you will be required to 
 come to Togo to open an account in any bank here in 
 Togo where the security company will deposit the total 
 sum in your favor. From this bank the money will be 
 remitted into your original bank in your country. 
 this done, all of us will depart Togo to 
 your country, where my children and I are expected to 
 take a temporary resident. 
 
 Please note that I can not open any Bank account with 
 my name because, My late husband's first 
 took over power in our country, don't 
 want to see me and my children, He claimed that when 
 our husband was alive, that I was very close to him 
 than any other of his wives including his (Joseph) 
 mother. He also claimed that because of my closeness 
 to him that I was able to get things from him more 
 than others. As a result he has been me. 
 Infact this one of the main reasons I want to take my 
children out of our country and any nearby country. 
 
 Thanking you in advance.

KAMBILI BOB 
3/5 RIDES GARDEN 
CLOSE JO'BURG, 
SOUTH AFRICA 
 
MY DEAR ,  
 
I am Bob Kambili, Bank manager of First national bank 
South Africa Pty, South and for 
reasons which will become obvious to you as read on, I 
obtained your address from an Internet 
address listing. Please exercise some patience and 
read through my message.  You can reach me 
on my private email address  
 
I have a very urgent and business  
for you. On June 6th 1998, a Gold 
with the South African National 
Gold Mr. Ahmed Youseff Mustafa , a 
national of Iraq, made a numbered time ( fixed) 
deposit for 12 calendar months, value  
(FIFTY TWO MILION DOLLAS)  in my 
branch.  
 
On maturity, we sent a routine to his  
address but got no reply. After a month,  
we sent a reminder and finally, his contract  
the South African National Gold 
wrote to inform us that Mr. A Y Mustafa died from an 
accident; that he died without making a 
WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin 
through the Iraqi embassy were At first I 
was surprised that I did not receive much official 
in my inquiries in order to trace his kin 
in Iraq, and inform them about Mr. Mustafa’s deposit 
of USD52m plus accrued interest. I therefore made 
further and that Mr. Mustafa 
had actively opposed the of President 
Saddam Hussein of Iraq, and was driven 
into exile. Being an minning Expert,he 
obtained a job with the South Africa Gold  
and settled in South Africa. he walked 
into my Office to make the deposit of 
USD52m. He did not declare any kin in his 
contrary to laid down and when 
I asked him he informed me that he wished it so. I 
accepted his because banks are 
and will always honour a 
wishes, high networth No one 
knows the source of his money because the 
time frame of his with the ASGC does indeed 
preclude such a large amount of money. It can be 
assumed that he brought his money over from Iraq, but 
that is open to However, the point is 
that his employers are not aware of this money , and 
therefore it can be safely assumed that no one will 
ever come forward to claim this money. This money 
total USD52m ( inclusive of accrued is 
still sitting in my Bank in the Dormant Account 
No one will ever come forward to claim it 
now, and according to South African law,  
after 5 years, the money will revert  
to the Federal Treasury if the Account  
owner is a is certified dead , and there is 
no valid claim. This indeed, is the My 
proposal therefore is that I am looking for a  
foreigner who will stand in as the next of kin to  
Mr. Mustafa. It is not necessary to be a blood  
relation to Mr. Mustafa, nor have the same name. It is 
not also necessary to come from the same Country. I 
have worked out the to achieve my aim of 
a next of kin, and therefore also by this 
means transfer this money total USD52m abroad for us 
to share.  
 
The method of achieving the objective of  
this money abroad in a legal 
and proper way is simple. I intend to use a n Attorney 
( you as to execute a series 
of in support of your claim. These will be 
approved.  
 
The money transfer paperwork itself will include a  
of origin so that the receiving bank  
does not ask questions or refuse the money as money  
Also, the paperwork will include proper  
that the funds being are  
from non criminal sources. In short this will be a  
proper and legal money transfer and there is no  
risk!. 
  
I will have to process the initial paperwork to  
obtain approval from the Probate Registry ( Ministry 
of Justice ) to obtain the Letter of 
you as Sole to the Estate 
of Mr. Mustafa.  
 
If you therefore agree to be the official  
then please note that you will not be  
required to sign any Money Transfer Documents ( my 
Attorney will do all (that), you will not be required 
to come to South Africa.  
 
Only the following is required from you:  
(1) Send to me A bank account ( a bank  
account with zero credit balance is ok)  
(2) Complete name and address of the Bank  
(3) Bank Account Number  
(4) Name of Account  
(5) Your address, phone and fax  
(6) A brief on you (CV)  
Once you send me the requested as  
above, I will initiate the of the transfer 
and in about 7 working days the money total USD52m 
will be in your nominated bank account for us to share 
in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% for you. This 
is to succeed without any 
problems. If you agree to assist me by sending me the 
above requested I will give you my 
complete address, including phone/ fax etc and any 
further you may require.  
Looking forward to your urgent reply.  
 
Yours truly

When he was still alive, he deposited one trunk box  
the sum  
of USD$30 million dollars in cash (Ten Million dollars).  
with a private  
security and safe deposit company here in Abidjan Cote  
This  
money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond by my  
mother and she  
have already decided to use this money for future  
of the  
family. 
Recently, I rushed down to Abidjan after being able to  
locate where my  
late father kept the Agreement made between  
himself and the  
security company. I have confirmed from the security  
company that the  
is in their custody, when I demanded for the  
release of the  
to me in my capacity of being the son of Mr  
Bangura,  
the depositor of the I was told that in the  
absence of my  
father, the only person that can demand for the release of

Dear Sir,  
 
I am Sam Aluko, former special adviser on Petroleum matters  
to the late  
Head of State of of Nigeria Gen. Sani Abacha.  
Because of my  
strategic position in the former and also being a  
close confidant  
of the late Head of State, I was able to acquire the  
sum of  
USD ( fifty million United States Dollars only)  
presently  
lodged in a Security Deposit in Europe. I made this money  
largely through  
FEE" and Good Faith Fees" paid by foreign Oil  
companies prior  
to of Deep Water Oil Blocs and other  
Right.  
Nigeria is the 6th largest of Crude Oil in  
the World.  
 
As you are probably aware of the fact that Nigeria is prone to  
Military coups and the resultant  
has fueled  
hyper amongst other problems. I have therefore  
resolved to  
invest my money abroad, in Real Estate  
and  
of Goods from your country for safety and optimum returns on  
 
However the, present civilian of President  
Olusegun Obasanjo  
has placed a of movement on every member of the  
cabinet of the  
past military This is as a result of the panel of  
inquiry  
slated to most of the by the  
late former  
head of state. This means that I cannot travel out now till the  
panel  
conclude its which only God knows when that  
would be.  
 
Straight transfer of this money into a bank abroad will present  
two major  
problems one, the tax incidence will be too high, as much as  
60% of this  
money will go up in Taxes, Levies, Penalties etc. as a result  
of  
on flight of capital Abroad. However  
 
have been put in place for you to receive this money from a  
trust worthy  
security Deposit Company in Europe. As soon as you indicate  
your interest.  
I will send to you the security Code number, of  
deposit number  
and airway bill number of the Deposit that will serve as the  
onus of proof  
to enable you claim the Money, which is tagged,  
Luggage.  
 
All I now need is an honest partner who can receive the money  
on my behalf  
and help me to invest as  
There is no risk involved in this as  
the money will  
be delivered to you in United States Dollars Bills.  
If you are in assisting me, please send to me by  
email  
your preferred contact address where you can be  
reached at any  
time, upon receipt of the money, you are to lodge this money in  
a bank  
account and contact me for necessary for the  
of the  
funds. For your help and in this deal, you will be  
entitled to  
25% of this money in cash or Equity if you wish to join the  
proposed  
company.  
 
Finally you are to please urgently send to me through the  
required contact address that include your telephone and fax  
number), so  
that I can instruct the West side Deposit Company to go ahead  
with the  
transfer to you  
 
Best regards,  
Sam Aluko

The tension and confusion in UNITA become when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death.

REPLY TO EMAIL ADDRESS:   
 
Dear Friend, 
  
SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE 
Please Permit me to make your in so 
informal a manner. This is by my urgent 
need to reach a and trust wordy foreign 
partner. This request may seem strange and 
but I will crave your and pray 
that you view it My name is MR Williams Daniel of the Republic of Congo and One of the 
close aides to the former President of the 
Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed 
memory, may his soul rest in peace. 
  
Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to 
force out the rebels in my country, I and some of my 
were by Late President Kabila 
to  go abroad to purchase arms and worth of 
Twenty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States 
Dollars only to fight the rebel 
group. But when President Kabila was killed in a 
bloody shoot-out by one of his aide a day before we 
were schedule to travel out of Congo, We  
decided to divert the fund into a private security 
company here in Congo for safe keeping. The security 
of the said amount is presently being here 
following the arrest and seizure of of Col. 
Rasheidi Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) 
a and some other Military Personnel from 
our same tribe, by the new President of the 
Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent 
Kabila, Joseph Kabila.  
In view of this, we need a reliable and 
foreign partner who can assist us to move this money 
out of my country as the 
WE have to move the fund under 
Cover to a security company in the europe 
in your name. This is to ensure that the 
Baggage is marked and it  will not 
pass through normal screening and 

Our inability to move this money out of Congo all 
This while lies on our lack of trust on our supposed 
good friends (western who suddenly became 
hostile to those of us who worked with the late 
President Kabila, after his son took 
office. Though we have neither seen nor met each 
other, the We gathered from an associate 
who has worked in your country has and 
convinced us that with your sincere this 
will be properly handled with modesty 
and honesty to a huge success within two weeks. The 
said money is a state fund and therefore requires a 
total 
Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund 
out of Congo, you can contact me through my email 
address above with your fax number and 
personal to enable us discuss the 
and what will be your share 
for assisting us. 
I must use this and medium to implore You 
to exercise the utmost to keep this Matter 
Whatever your Decision, 
while I await your prompt response. Thank you and 
GodBless.

FROM : MR TUNDA USENI 
 EMAIL ADDRESS: 
 
 URGENT BUSINESS 
 
      Dear Sir, My name is MR TUNDA USENI the eldest son of Rtd General 
 J. T. USENI who was the est. while Minister of the Federal 
 Capital territory Abuja in the late General Sani Regime of 
 1993- 
 1998. I am you in a spirit; utmost and 
 trust to enable us provide a solution to a money transfer of $60M that is 
 presently putting my entire family into great disarray. You may be quite 
 surprised at my sudden contact to you but do not despair, I got your 
 contact from a business site on the internet and following the 
 I gathered about you, I was convinced that you could be of 
 to me. So, decided to contact you at once due to the urgency 
 required for us to transfer the said funds out of the 
 country. During the time my father was in the with the late 
 General Sani Abacha as the head of state, they were both involved in 
 several deals that yielded Billions of Dollars. The prominent amongst the 
 deals was monies that emanated from funds set aside for the 
 of Arms and to boost the Nigerian Defense, funds set to 
 embark on an oversea campaign to counter the United States action to put 
 a stop to the self bid of the to 
 retain 
 power, and monies set aside to the ailing Nigerian Petroleum 
 and the National Electric Power Authority which supplies 
 to the entire nation. If you are with world news, 
 you would better. During this period my father was able to 
 make some good money for himself and kept in his private bank accounts. 
 The then head of state General Sani Abacha his share of the 
 money through a Lebanese Chagoury and a Jewish 
 Mark Rissar to bank accounts overseas. all the secrets 
 were revealed by the agencies set up by the 
 and most of the loots were traced and 
 
 from the various accounts to the Federal Treasury. Out of the 
 money my father made, he left the sum of N50 Million (Fifty Million 
 Naira) in the CBN escrow account for further transfer into a foreign 
 account and a sum of $60M (Sixty Million Dollars) was kept in a Private 
 security firm here in Nigeria. Through the made by the 
 Family, the N50 Million was recovered by the 
 agency from the CBN escrow account. But were unable to discover the $60M, 
 which he kept in the vaults. The reason is because no names were used to 
 lodge in the funds. Instead, he used PERSONAL NUMBERS 
 (PIN) and declared the contents as Bearer Bonds and Treasury Bills. Also 
 the firm issued him with a of deposit of the 
 Note that I have these in my custody. Right now, my father 
 has been arrested and detained for As the eldest son of my 
 Father, I believe that I owe the entire family an to ensure 
 that the $60M is abroad for purposes. 
 With the present I cannot do it all by myself. It is based on 
 this that I am making this contact with you. I have done a thorough 
 homework and the best way to create you as the to 
 the funds and effect the transfer Is rest assured that the 
 I have resolved to finalize the entire project our 
 safety and the transfer of the funds. So, you will be 
 right when you say that this project is risk free and viable. 
 If you are capable and willing to assist, contact me at once via email 
 for more details. Believe me, there is no one else we can trust again. 
 All my friends have deserted us after us on the 
 pretence of trying to help my father. As it is said, \\\"it is at the time 
 of problems that you know your true So long as you keep 
 to yourself, we would have no problems. For your 
 I am ready to give you as much as 20% of the total funds 
 after transfer and invest a into any viable 
 business you may suggest. Please, I need your to make this 
 happen and please; do not undermine it because it will also be a source 
 of up liftment to you also. You have nothing to loose in 
 assisting us instead, you have so much to gain. Awaiting your urgent and 
 positive response.

Dear sir 
 
I wish to solicit your help in migrating to your 
country and investing my funds. 
Briefly, I am a Sierra Leonean National and the wife 
of late Dr SIMON LAMINE. 
Until his death, my husband was the General overseer 
of the Diamond and Gold Mining in Kanema, 
Sierra Leone. On April 6 2000 the military forces 
loyal to the of Ahmed TIJAN KABBAH invaded 
the Diamond and Gold mine and my husband, 
mistaking him for his brother MIKE LAMINE who is the 
deputy to the leader of the United 
Front (RUF ) FODAY SANKOH. 
 
When the news reached me, I hurried gathered some 
valuables in our family villa and escaped for my dear 
life in the company of my only son PETERS. 
 
Among the valuables was a file that contained details 
of a Deposit my husband made in a security company in 
Europe. He deposited US$ 15.5 M  contained 
in 1 Trunk Box in the name of our son PETERS as 
family He did not disclose the 
real contents of the box to the security company. 
Rather, he declared the deposit as Family Valuables 
for security reasons. This is the money he made from 
the sale of Gold and diamonds during his time as the 
General overseer. 
We need your sincere to move this funds out from the  
security 
company IN EUROPE for 
in your country as we cannot invest here due to its 
nearess to our country and the war still going on 
there. Besides, our Refugee Status here cannot help 
matters for us. We also ask you to scout for a viable 
and lucrative business, so that we can invest wisely. 
 
We have it in mind to give your 30 % of the total sum 
(15.5 million US Dollars), and 20% share in any 
we will embark upon if you assist us. We 
will also set aside 5% of the funds for ancillary 
expenses which you will make in course of this 
air tickets and handling expenses etc. 
 
This fortune we have revealed to you should remain 
as it only you who we have told about it. 
pleaselet me have your phone/fax numbers for more detials. 
 
Note that this is risk free. 
May God Bless you as you assist us. 
Yours Sincerely ,

Re: Urgent Needed 
 
By way of I am Eng. Farouk I represent my family as the oldest son of the Al-Bashar family, who are the of Ibrahim Al-Bashar Ali from one of the oil rich areas in Iraq. Over the years my family has acquired huge sums of money from royalties for the of oil in our region but over the past 15 years, Saddam Hussein and his gangs of bandits have taken our oils without payments and we can not complain as those who did are all dead. In the wake of the Gulf War of 1990, our family withdrew most moneys that remain in coded bank accounts that Saddam did not find and we hide it in a secret chamber where it remained safe until after the war. At the end of Gulf war, we moved the funds into a private vault of a security company in Baghdad, where it was until we collected it a few days ago on the fear of the eminent war with America. 
 
We pray they remove Saddam as he is the cause of much hardship here, but our funds are trapped here and there is no avenue to transfer any amount from Iraq without Saddam knowing. The problem now is how do we transfer the funds totalling US$12.5 Million in cash from here. 
 
We are afraid that with the capacity of the bombs America is coming to Baghdad with nowhere would be safe for the money, so we need you to help in securing a private agency who would come to Iraq and collect the money and have them moved to the west, where our family is planning to relocate to as life in Iraq is no longer worth living because of Saddam. 
 
I have to travel lots of miles each day to send an email hoping someone out there would assist this family, if you can we will give you the details of an agency that can lift the funds from here as given to me by a US Marine. The private agency would then collect the fund from here and deliver it to you for safe keep. Hoping the American campaign would be we would then come over to your country 
for a meeting to share the funds and hopefully start a new life with you as a partner. 
 
For your with this project the family is willing to give you 10% of the funds, however if this does not suit you we are open for 
 
We eagerly await your response so we can inform you of the next line of action.

Dear Sir, 
In of your esteemed contact received 
through a reliable source and the choice of your 
country I wish to introduce myself, I am Mr.James 
Kabila the son of the late Republic of 
Congo President Laurent Desire Kabila of the blessed 
memory.I know this letter might come to you as a 
surprise butI honestly do not intend to surprise you. 
I write this letter in respect of my intention to 
invest the sum of Five Million United 
State Dollars) with you.I inherited this money from my 
mother. This money was got through the smuggling and 
sales of Diamond and Timber when my father was the 
head of state. My mother though not her legal wife 
used her privilege position to engage in the business 
of Diamond and Timber since she knows that her 
survival will depend on how much she can get out of 
the privilege   When my father was 
on 16TH Jan. 01 by one of his 
Lt. Rashidi Kasereke through the of some 
top army officers that wanted to topple him. I escaped 
to Madrid, Spain because of the fear that I might be 
arrested by my half brother Joseph Kabila 
the present head of his mother and my 
mother are not in the best of because of 
who among them will be the first lady tussle and this 
affected us their mother 
advised me to leave For Madrid, Spain where these 
funds were deposited for safe keeping with a Private 
Security Company here in Spain.On getting to  Spain 
where I have been living since then as a political 
refugee, I am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can 
come down to Madrid, Spain for a meeting and to clear 
the funds in his name as the sole of the 
as I was afraid of being defraud. Honestly 
I contacted you because I don't want to invest this 
money in Madrid Spain due to my status here as a 
political Refugee. And moreover I wouldn't want to 
take risk because this money is all that my Mother and 
I are depending on. My step brother is now 
the present leader of my country has seized all my 
father's assets and money. He left us empty handed 
without knowing about this funds deposited with the 
Security Company here. That is why I decided that 
investing this money abroad should be the best 
for me. I will be honored if I can be given 
the privilege of investing this money with you. I 
expect you to be trust worthy and kind enough to 
respond to this distress call to save My Mother and I 
from a hopeless future. And if you agree, I hereby 
agree to your sincere and candid effort in 
this regard with 15% of the total amount of  
US Dollars. When the money ($35 million) is 
moved into your discrete account. You will be allowed 
to draw 15% in your favor, while the remaining 85% 
will be invested meaning fully for our future if 
possible in your area of business and different 
sectors of the Economy in your country which are 
dividends your decision is please 
reach me keep this letter tight secret 
for the interest of my Family. 
Best regards,  
Mr.James Kabila.

Dear Sir, 
 
I am Mr. Dayo Naps, an official with one of the APEX banks in and I have an urgent and very  
business proposal for you. On the 6th of June 1998 an American miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an account with us and 
his present balance is valued at Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States 
 Dollars Only) in my Bank. We sent a routine to his address but got no reply. After a month, we 
sent a reminder and finally, we from his employers that he died from an accident. On further 
we found out from his account file that he never made a will and all attempts to trace his next of kin was 
as he had none. We therefore made further and that Mr. Travis Myers did not  
declare any next of kin or relations in all his official documents in the bank files. This sum of is still  
lying in the bank and the principal sum and interest is being rolled over at the end of every year. As it is now, no one  
will ever come forward to claim this money. According to the Nigeria law, at the of 5 (five) years, the money  
will revert to the ownership of the if  
 
my proposal is that I would like you to stand in as the next of kin of Mr. Travis Myers. This is simple; all  
we need is some of your details so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and which would 
put you in place as Mr. Myers's next of kin. We shall also employ the services of an Attorney for the drafting 
and of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letters of in your  
favour for the transfer. The money would be shared in the ration of 75% for us and 25% for you. 
 
There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this will be done by the Attorney and my position as a manager  
the execution of this If you are please reply via email. 
 
Please observe utmost and be rest assured that this would be most for us. I shall  
still require your to invest my own share in your country just incase you can help, otherwise we'll take our  
share .  
 
Awaiting your urgent reply.

Your strictest and kind highly required. 
 
Greetings to you, 
 
With warm heart I offer my and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However strange or this letter might seem to you as we have not met or had any dealings in the past, I humbly ask that you take due of its and immense benefit. Also I duly apologize for on your privacy, if this contact is not to you, as I make this proposal to you as a person of 
 
First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly to you. My name is Oliveira Chuli Savimbi, I am a nephew and Personal Assistant to Late Jonas Malheiro Savimbi, leader of UNITA (National Union for the Total of Angola). As led by my instinct, I selected your email address from an internet in my search for a partner, hence this email. I also crave your to read this and have a general overview of my  
 
My Uncle (Mentor) was killed in a battle with forces of Angola, led by President Dos Santos, on Friday 22nd February 2002. After his death, Mr. Antonio Dembo who was his second in command, assumed office as leader of UNITA, due to the lack of Charisma my Uncle had carried the party with in Dembo, there was chaos and struggle for Prominent members like Carlos Morgado lobbied to depose him and assume office as leader to enrich and some of them who saw me as a threat to their including Mr.Dembo, planned to kill me. The tension and confusion in UNITA become when Mr. Dembo died 10days after my Uncle's death. As I already lost my mentor in this struggle that has been on for three decades now, not so much of the struggle me anymore, as there was no more sense of I then desired a peaceful life, as I no more had interest in conflicts and wars.

Good Day, 
 
With warm heart I offer my and my and I hope 
this letter meets you in good time. It will be  to you to 
receive this proposal from me since you do not know me 
However, I am sincerely seeking your in this 
which I propose with my free mind and as a person of  My name 
is  Owen Mubane, the first son of Mapele Mubane, of the  most popular 
black farmer  from Zimbabwe, murdered in the land  dispute in my 
country. As led by my instict, I decided to contact you  through email, 
after searching  for contacts via the internet, as it  is the only means 
I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties  with Zimbabwe for 
security and safety reasons.  However, I apologize  if this is not 
to you. 
 
The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed in  a 
business venture. Due to the land and political problems in  Zimbabwe, 
as a result of President Robert Mugabe's of  new Land Act 
Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and the  few rich black 
farmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life,  my father for saw 
the danger that came in Zimbabwe. Before he was  murdered, he withdrew 
all of our business foreign accounts in dollars  and sold up our shares 
in major We then went to  SOUTH AFRICA  to deposit the sum of 
US$14.5 million  (Fourteen million, Five Hundred thousand US dollars), 
in a private  security company. This money was deposited with this 
Private Security  company for safety and security reasons, and  was to 
be used for the  purchase of land, new machines and chemicals 
of new  farms in Europe. 
 
President Mugabe's support for the violent  war veterans  and 
some lunatics in the society, led to the murder of my beloved  father 
and other innocent lives. I was to  abandon my 
from my father after he was murdered. I  resited for a 
while, but when the danger became and I  survived two murder 
attempts, I fled Zimbabwe.  I am currently staying in the 
where I am seeking  political asylum. In fact my decision to come here 
to seek asylum, is  because the security company from South Africa, has 
a branch here,  and they have moved the deposit from their office in 
down  here. I need to transfer this money to  an account 
and invest part of  the money. Since the law of prohibits a 
refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any = 
financial 
this is why  I am seeking a genuine and reliable  partner, 
whose account this money can be hence this  proposal to 
you.You have to that this decision taken by me  entrusts my 
future and in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping  of this 
money. If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for  me, is to 
assist with to claim the deposit from the  security company 
from their office here in The as it has  now been 
from South Afri!  ca to their branch here. The 
company will be legally informed of you  me. 
 
For your I have two options for you. Firstly you can 
choose to have 10% of the money for your and helping me 
open an account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go  into 
with me for the proper of the  money 
in your country. Whichever the option you want, please to  notify me in 
your reply.  I have also set aside of this money for all 
kinds of  expenses that come our way in the process of this 
and 4% for Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 10% 
for assisting with opening an account, then 85%will be left in the 
account here for me. 
 
Please, I want you maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose  of 
this  I look forward to your reply and and I 
thank you in  advance as I your can reach me 
on my  direct line which is 31 617 562  914 or via email

Dear Sir, 
You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me I am Gabriel Kali, the first son of Gadik kali, one of the most popular black farmers in Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country. I got your contact through network online hence decided to write you. Before the death of my father, he had taken me to to deposit the sum of US15.5 million (FIFTEEN MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS), in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and of new farms in This land problem came when President Mr. Robert Mugabe a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob! 
  action by war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims. It is against this that, my family and I fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the Nigeria where we are seeking political asylum and however have decided to transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account. Since the law of this country prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial the zone. As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be without the knowledge of my who are bent on taking we have got. The South African seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of this country for! 
  fear of going through the same in future, both countries h 
ave similar political history. I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands. If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is to make an with the security company to clear the (funds) from their affiliate office here as I have already given for the to be brought to the from South Africa. But before then all will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the and more this money I intend to use for I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have certain of the money for your account for this Or you can go into with me for the proper of the money in your country. Whichever the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred in the process of thi! 
 s If you do not prefer a I am willing to give you 15% of the money while the remaining 80% will be for my in your country. Contact me with the above E-mail address while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in this  
Thanks, GOD BLESS YOU

Dear Friend. 
 
 As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for 
 me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. 
 
 My name is Saidi Fatou, a merchant in Dubai, in the 
 U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with cancer 
 which was very late, due to my laxity in 
carrying for my health. It has defiled all forms of 
 medicine, and right now I have only about a few 
 months to live, according to medical experts. 
 
 I have not lived my life so well, as I 
 never really cared for anyone not even myself but my 
 business. Though I am very rich, I was never 
 generous, I was always hostile to people and only 
 focus on my business as that was the only thing I 
cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know 
that there is more to life than just wanting to have 
 or make all the money in the world. 
I believe when God gives me a second chance to come 
 to this world I would live my life a different way 
 from how I have lived it. Now that God ! has called 
 me, I have willed and given most of my 
 and assets to my immediate and extended family 
 members and as well as a few close friends. 
 I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul 
 and so, I have decided to give alms to charity 
 as I want this to be one of the last 
 good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have 
 money to some charity in the U.A.E, 
 Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has 
 so badly, I cannot do this my self any 
 more. I once asked members of my family to close one 
 of my accounts and the money which I have 
 there to charity in Bulgaria and 
 Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to 
 Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as 
 they seem not to be contended with what I have left 
 for them. 
 The last of my money which no one knows of is the 
 huge cash deposit of twenty four million dollars 
 that I have with a Bank in london. 
 I will want you to help me collect this deposit and 
it to charity me 
 at 
 I have set aside 10% for you for your time and 
 patience. 
 
God be with you. 
 
 Saidi Fatou.

REPLY STRICTLY VIA: 
Attn: sir,  
 
Permit me to introduce myself to you, My name is Johnson Elendu., I am one of the Senior Managers in the bank I work for (Union Bank, Nigeria PLC) and I work under the Director of Foreign Exchange I am You presently because I need your urgent in a business that will be of immense benefit to both of us.  
I have the immediate need to transfer some money that has long been  
declared by the chairman and some members of the board of  
directors of our bank. The money is the closing balance of one of our best customers ever, Late Engr. Manfred Becker, I was his personal account officer just before he died in the ADC plane crash of 1996 in Nigeria.  
Engr. Manfred Becker an American citizen was a with the  
Federal of Nigeria, he supplied and installed equipment and his company Creek land completed some of the best contracts in the country. His closing balance in the Bank, Union Bank of Nigeria PLC has been tagged Unclaimed because no relative of Engr. Becker has come forward to make a statement of claim. We have no knowledge of a next of kin. At this point I trust you can picture what the situation is like. We have strong proof that the chairman and the board of directors will keep most of the money for and donate the remainder to a military trust here in Nigeria. This  
is an attempt to infuse more money into the of military  
equipment (arms and for use in an already prostrate Africa.  
This of course, is hence my mission.  
My and my self have made several attempts at locating  
persons that could be remotely related to Engr. Becker and we have been doing this  
for about 4 years now. Right now I am almost alone in this and I have presently decided on moving the money to a foreign account. I am hereby your and I will be very grateful if you will be willing to help in this regard.  
 
We have access to most of what it will take to transfer the money. The only thing we do not have is a safe account. We will provide you with answers to all the security which you will have to answer to move the process towards We will also provide you answers to questions that only a person related to him will know. You may however not need to make any every thing will be concluded on phone and email between you and the bank [UNION BANK NIGERIA PLC, LAGOS] for your you will get 30%, 5% has been earmarked for the expenses that may be incurred on both ends. 65%shall be for my colleague and I.  
 
I make this proposal in trust and in good faith, if you are and you agree to assist me then contact me you receive this email, there is a lot more to talk about. If you are not then, please, do get rid of this email and please forgive me if this message has upset you in any way.

head of state of Sierra Leone (MAJOR JOHNNY KOROMAH). 
However, when the ECOMOG peace keeping force struck, 
his was forced to run into Liberia on exile 
while some of his aides left for some other 

While these events took place, I decided to move to 
CÃ´te d?Ivoire with my family and a total sum of  
thirty million US dollars which was 
the part of cash under my control within the 
mansion when I was in change of 
On getting to Abidjan, I 
deposited the fund in a bank in Abidjan the economic capital of Cote 
D'Ivoire. 
 
I sincerely implore you as a partner to

to you for purposes and in 
order to actualise this proposal. You are 
implored to assist in the 
 
1)You are required to provide a safe foreign bank 
accounts into which the money could be 
2)You shall serve as a general overseer and guardian 
of this fund and all the 
3)And you shall benefit 20% of the total sum for your 
efforts and absolute in ensuring that this 
fund is into your accounts

Having stated the above clearly, I expect your soonest

MR MIKE JIDE 

Dear Sir, 
 
 I work with a Bank called IBTC in my country, in the foreign 
exchange and I'm the deputy head of my 
 
Our major objective is the operation of foreign accouunts for 
states and highly placed citizens of my country and other 
those at the helm of affairs, and 
business men.We also make sure the Forex market is 
well and checked. 
 
One of those highly and placed citizen is Joseph 
Nanven Garba, (Major General Rtd). Until his demise, he held 
sensitive positions in the military, and diplomat seat, one of 
the office he held , was the position of the personal assistant 
to the U.N secretary general, Koffi Annan. His death was a shock 
to the entire nation, the man in quote operates several foreign 
accounts in our which I mannage myself due to his 
position in the country. Such of accounts is called 
"Private Banking" where the deposits will only be known to the 
owner of the acounts and officer of the bank in charge. 
 
of the total deposit is supposed to be turned into 
the Federal account and 30%, 5% given to the family 
and bank  This is what the banking law and policy 
of my country states, When this is achieved i.e transfer of the 
Federal account part, the people at the corridors of 
power withdraw these funds, under the disguise of security issues 
but make use of for their personal and family use. 
This is a case of injustice on the officer in charge of the 
account and the family of the deceased. So I released the code of 
the account partly totaling just 50% of the initial deposit. 
Since the code of the account is in between me and the deceased 
the fear of being checked is ruled out but I cannot make 
from this account myself and that is where you come 
in. 
 
All you need to do for this is to follow the 
procedure binding this contract together and I guarantee you 
risk free. However your will be

Beloved in Christ, 
 
It is a to hear from God and it gives me 
joy to relate my testimony to you haven recieved 
from God through divine 
 
I was a Moslem and a retired military top officer in 
Nigerian Army that served under the past military 
regime. I was the financial secretary to the Armed 
Force Ruling Council (AFRC). With my position as a  
financial I was able to secure up to 
hundred and fourty  six million us 
dollars which i deposited with a finance and security 
company in a country that will be disclosed to you 
later as you indicate interest. I wanted to use this 
fund to context for the post of the president of 
Nigeria in the next republic. 
 
I got retired, I was converted from Moslem 
to Christian when I was preached the words of God 
through my cousin the pastor of my church I then gave 
my life to Christ and became a born again 
 
Since I gave my life to Christ, I had no rest of mind. 
Some times I think of the souls I killed when I was a 
soldier and the dubious ways I diverted my country’s 
money into my Personal Bank Account. I then decided to 
 
seek the face of God for and after fasting 
and prayer through Divine the Almighty God 
revealed to me that the only way I could have rest of 
mind is when I used my wealth to do the work of God.  
I have been thinking of the thing to do for 
my God before this present civilian president of my 
country set up  a Oputa Panel) to 
probe the Bank Account of the past Military officers 
like me. They suceeded in finding out the funds I have 
in my personal Bank accouts in Nigeria and they have 
seized all my money.I am still facing their charges 
but i have refused to disclose to them that i have 
such money somewhere and they can never find out 
because I want to use part of it to do the work of 
GOD. 
 
I have decided to use part of this fund for charity 
instead of loosing it to my I am presently 
under house arrest and my movement is 
that contained the money is now 
demurage in the country because the 
agreement time with the security company has passed. I 
have been  making to sneak out and clear 
it but I can not travel out now.I sent a message to 
the security company that I am sending somebody to 
come and claim the want a honest 
christain who will not run away with my money and who 
will be honest to use part of the fund for things of 
God and let the name of the lord be glorify and so 
that I can have rest of mind as the Lord told me.If 
you are in going to claim the fund,I will 
disclose to you where i deposited the money and every 
document to claim the fund will be fax to you. 
 
I am still making to see if I can sneak 
out of the country with my family.As soon as you claim 
the use half of it for GOD`S WORK and keep 
half of it for me till I come over to meet you. 
If you are in send to me your 
full to submit it to the security 
company as the person coming to claim the 
 
I look forward to your response 
 
God bless you.

Dear Sir,  
 
I am Mr. Philip jones, an official with one of the APEX  
banks in and I have an urgent  
and very  
business proposal for you. On the 6th of June 1998 an  
American miner, Mr. Travis Myers ran an account with  
us and his present balance is valued at  
Million, Five Hundred  
Thousand United States Dollars Only) in my Bank. We  
sent a routine to his address  
but got no reply. After a month, we  
sent a reminder and finally, we from his  
employers that he died from an accident. On  
further we found out from his account  
file that he never made a will and all attempts to  
trace his next of kin was as he had none.  
We therefore made further and  
that Mr. Travis Myers did not declare any  
next of kin or relations in all his official documents  
in the bank files. This sum of is still  
lying in the bank and the principal sum and interest  
is being rolled over at the end of every year. As it  
is now, no one will ever come forward to claim this  
money. According to the Nigeria law, at the  
of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the  
ownership of the if  
 
my proposal is that I would like you  
to stand in as the next of kin of Mr. Travis Myers.  
This is simple; all we need is some of your details so  
that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents  
and which would put you in place as Mr.  
Myers's next of kin. We shall also employ the services  
of an Attorney for the drafting and  
of the WILL and to obtain the necessary  
documents and letters of in  
your favour for the transfer. The money would be  
shared in the ration of 75% for us and 25% for you.  
 
There is no risk at all as the paperwork for this  
will be done by the Attorney and my  
position as a manager the  
execution of this If you are  
please reply via email.  
 
Please observe utmost and be rest  
assured that this would be most  
for us. I shall still require your to  
invest my own share in your country just incase you  
can help, otherwise we'll take our share .  
 
Awaiting your urgent reply,  
 
Mr.Philip Jones.  
 
Dear Sir,  
My name is Venus Savimbi, the nephew of the late  
jonas savimbi the former leader of the UNITA rebel  
fighters in Angola. I am presently in Europe, where I  
intend to look for a credible business partner to  
assist my brother and I take physical pocession of a  
of money, precisely  
(Twenty five million five hundred thousand united  
states dollars) which my uncle kept under the custody  
of my father in a security company in Ghana.  
 
My parents was killed along with my uncle, and in his  
will he clearly stated that my brother and I should  
look for a credible who would assist us in  
investing these funds, as we are not with  
in the world business and we  
have never been in posession of such funds all our  
lives. For these reasons, he believes that the only  
way we can live without him is if we get someone very  
vast in the field of business and to help  
us claim the funds and invest it on our behalf, so we  
can further our as well as living our  
lives the way he wants us to.  
 
My brother is in Ghana, looking after the money in the  
security company, and he has asked that I travel out  
to Europe to look for a foreign partner to assist us.  
I would furnish you with his telephone numbers as soon  
as I receive your response, so you can deal with him  
directly, as he has all the modalties for the release  
of the  
 
We have both decided that we would make available to  
you for your 15% of the total sum of money  
involved, but we have also decided to leave it open to  
 
I would give you more details as soon as I hear from  
you. Till then I expect your prompt response.  
 
Yours

I write you in respect of a foreign customer with 
A/C number His name is 
Engineer Joseph He was among 
those who died in a plane crash here in Nigeria during 
the reign of late General Sani Abacha. 
 
Sir,since the demise of this our customer, 
who was an oil have kept a 
close watch of the deposit records and since 
then no body has come to claim the money in this a/c as next 
of kin to the late Engineer. He had only in his 
a/c and the 
a/c is coded. It is only an insider that could produce the 
code or password of the deposit As it stands 
now, there is nobody in that position to produce the needed 
other than my very self my position 
in the bank. 
 
Based on the reason that nobody has come forward to claim 
the deposit as next of kin, I hereby ask for your co 
operation in using your name as the  
next of kin to the deceased to send these funds out to a 
foreign offshore bank a/c for mutual sharing between myself 
and you. At this point I am the only one with the 
because I have removed the deposit file from the 
safe . 
 
By this doing, what is required of you is to send an 
laying claims of the deposit as next of kin to 
the late Engineer. 
 
I will need your full name and address, company or 
so that i can them to tally with 
next of kin column in the of deposit. 
 
Finally i want you to that the request for a 
foreigner as the next of kin is by the fact that 
the customer was a foreigner and for that reason alone a 
local cannot represent as next of kin. When you contact me, 
then we shall discuss on how the money will be split between 
us.

Based on the reason that nobody has come forward to claim the deposit as next of kin, I hereby ask for your co operation in using your name as the next of kin to the deceased to send these funds out to a foreign offshore bank a/c for mutual sharing between myself and you. At this point I am the only one with the because I have removed the deposit file from the safe .  
 
By this doing, what is required of you is to send an laying claims of the deposit as next of kin to the late Engineer. I will need your full name and address, company or so that i can them to tally with next of kin column in the of deposit. Finally I want you to  
that the request for a foreigner as the next of kin is by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and for that reason alone a local cannot represent as next of kin. When you contact me, then we shall discuss on how the money will be split between us.  
 
Trusting to hear from you, I remain  
 
yours,

Dear friend 
 
My proposal to you will be very as we have not had any 
personal contact. However I sincerely seek your in this 
which I propose to you as a person of and caliber 
 
Let me first start by myself properly to you My name 
is Carlos Savimbi cousin and Personal Assistant of Jonas Malheiro 
Savimbi the leader UNITA (National Union for the Total 
of Angola) I got your email address from network directory I apologize 
if I infringed  on your privacy. 
 
You may know that my Uncle was recently killed in a battle with 
the troops of Angola led by President Dos Santos on friday 22nd 
February 2002 
 
Now Mr Antonio Dembo who was my Uncle's second in command has 
assumed office as leader of UNITA In spite of this UNITA is like 
a herd of cattle without shepherd Prominent members like Carlos 
Morgado are still lobbying to oust him and assume office as leader 
to enrich and some of them who see me as a threat to 
their ambitions including Mr Dembo are planning to kill me For 
more check 
 
However I am a young man who has ambitions and I am not in any 
way in wars this is why I secretly left Angola

money US$20 million was already on its way to my Uncle's Swiss 
Bank account It was on transit with a safe deposit company 
in Europe when the tragic incident of my Uncle's death occurred. 
 
As a matter of fact this is the reason I chose to come and 
seek political asylum. It is very clear with the way things are 
now that President Dos Santos will lobby the Community 
 
to freeze my Uncle's assets and accounts abroad to ground UNITA 
since he has already done this in Angola. 
 
I plan to use this money to safeguard my future It is very essential

shall remain in your custody till my asylum is granted 
and I have the permit to conduct business then you will transfer 
the account to me Meanwhile the money can be invested into risk-free 
ventures and there will an agreement to protect my interest.

regarding the business would then be brought to your

bring us to the of the

Best  
   
DR ALI AHMED=2E  
 
Greetings and 
 
I have gotten your contact from the internet, listed as a  
 
whom I might be able to transact with, and this makes me  
feel I may  
make a sincere to you, and I have decided to  
make this to you in good faith, which relates  
to a realistic and genuinely business opening  
that needs the of a person with your  
and ingenuity and a clear to 
and 
 
I am a lawyer residing and in Nigeria as you  
may need to know and I represent the interest of a client  
who is a Brother as well who has made an offer to me which  
is most my with you from hence  
is dictated by the need for us to get the of  
a neutral foreigner who will assist us perfect the  

My client was a prominent figure in the Military Politics  
and rule of  
my country for about ten years and he has had  
in a few economic scandals and a host of too  
he has had a lot of his physical and monetary assets  
seized by the Nigerian who consider him as a  
part of the corrupt machinery of the then Military  
Now he has a amount deposited in a  
bank in Nigeria (US$ 25.M.) and he is very scared that  
this account will be because similar accounts  
in and England were and  
frozen by the of those countries in  
with the of Nigeria. 
 
my client's family returned US$ 1B. to the  
of Nigeria in 2002 under the direction of the  
Swiss banking this is a matter,  
even as the existence of the fund mentioned above is  
 
Now it is his intention to migrate with his family out of  
Nigeria  
towards the Middle East and he depends so much on this  
fund, thus he is 
looking for a reliable and person who will  
receive the money 
and then transfer the money at a latter date to  
a neutral account to be in Lebanon when he  
finally succeeds with his plan. 
 
If you accept my and agree to in  
this  
you will in no case undertake  
risk- expend  
money or execute any task- whereas you will  
be well in principle you will receive 10% of  
the amount to you once the is  

Apart from this there is another sum of Money, held up in  
a Security  
Company (In Cash), the Money was earmarked for the support  
of the cause of Charity in India, but it was never  
retrieved before the demise  
of my clients father, now my client also wants to retrieve  
this money in addition to the money with the bank in  
Nigeria. The money with the Security Company is Thirty one  
Million American Dollars in one hundred dollar bills. 
 
Since I do not know in what vein you will take this  
missive I have kept  
the I will be posited to give  
further upon your and will also  
introduce you to my client  I hope I will be  
able to work with you earnestly unto our joint success. 
 
I await your response eagerly.

            URGENT NEEDED 
You may be surprise to receive this Email from me since you do not know me 

However, I would like to introduce myself. I am Michael Stevens Junior, the 
son of Doctor. Simon Stevens. Who was murdered few months ago in Zimbabwe, 
as a result of land dispute? Before the death of my father (Dr. Stevens), he 
had taken me to Amsterdam and deposit the sum of Fifteen Million United 
States dollars in a security company, as he foresaw the 
looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money in question was deposited in a box as 
Gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security company. The proposed 
amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the 
farms and of new farms on As you may be aware this 
land problem came into force when Zimbabwe president Mr. Robert Mugabe 
the Land Reformed Act of which my father rich farmers and some 
black farmers where affected. This resulted to the killing and Mob action by 
Zimbabwe war veterans and some lunatics in the society, a lot of people were 
killed because of this Land reformed act of which my dad was one of the 
victims. It is against this that my family and Iaugustim who are 
currently staying in Amsterdam decided to transfer my father's money to a 
foreign account. Since the Dutch law prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to 
open any account or be involved in any financial As 
The eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the of seeking 
a genuine foreign account where the money could be I am faced 
with the dilemma of investing this amount of money in Holland for the fear 
of going through the same in future since both countries have 
similar history. Moreover, The foreign exchange policy does not 
allow such from asylum seekers. I humbly solicit for your 
in the 
1) Pay a short working day visit to Amsterdam the so that we see 
face to face, Have a table talk that would create in me that the 
funds will be safe in your hands and have an agreement from an advocate, 
which will be duly and legally sign in his chambers before taken any step in 
this 
2) Get the entire necessary document regarding this and claim 
the boxes from the security company, open an account in your name with a 
local bank here and deposit the money for onward transfer to your 
account in overseas. 
3) Make a good for and do invest the money for me, I 
am willing to give you some for your on this, and I 
offer you 15%. 5% for any expenses, including your telephone calls and any 
other expenses that may arise during this process. 80% would be invested and 
you get your wages monthly for managing the funds. Contact me on the above 
Email, provide me with your telephone and fax number so we can discuss 
further and a chance for you to ask me any question you may have in mind,

 private security firm OVERSEAS as Family Deposits (FD) No record ever 
existed 
 
 the money 
 
neither is the money traceable by the because there is no 
documents 
 
 showing that we received the money from the Russians. 
 
However, due to the current situation in the country the present 
 
 civilian hostile attitude towards my family, it has become quite 
 
 for me to make use of the money within the country. Thus I seek 
 
 your

his family Deposits (FD) into your account for pending my 
arrival 
 
 in 
 your country for purposes. 
 
On your consent, I shall provide you with a POWER OF ATTORNEY to collect

 deposit with the security company OVERSEAS on our behalf. Bearing in mind 
that 
 
 your is needed in this regards, I propose a of 20% 
 (TWENTY PERCENT) of the 
 
total sum to you for the expected services and 10% for local and 
expenses if any. 
 
Your urgent response is highly needed so as to start further contact . 
I therefore mandate Barrister GREG ADO who is our family Attorney to deal 
 
 with 
 you through out this on my behalf.

 business demands whatever your decision and hope you will not betray the 
trust 
 
 and which I repose in you.

the 
promotion is on now. You can join for free and bring other members 
into the program to get a great residual income for life. They are 
promoting it through MLM and paying on 5 levels. This is going to 
get huge and people who act now will be earning a lot of money  in 
the years to come.

My Lordship,  
  
Calvary greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, I am former Mrs. Fatima Abass Yakubu Idris now Mrs Mary Abass Yakubu Idris, a widow to Late Sheik Abass Yakubu Idris. 
  
I am 65years old; I am now a new Christian from long time cancer of the breast. From all my condition is really and is quite obvious that I may not live more than six months, because the cancer stage has gotten to a very Severe stage. 
  
My late husband was killed during the Gulf war, and during the period of our marriage we had a son who was also killed in a cold blood during the Gulf war. My late husband was very wealthy and after his death,I inherited all his business and wealth. My personal physician told me that I may not live for more than six months and I am so scared about this.  
  
So, I now decided to divide part of this wealth, by to the of in is in my Europe and Asian mission, which will no doubt be tasking had made me to recently relocate to Nigeria, Africa where I live  
  
I selected you and your church after visiting the website for this Purpose and prayed over it, I am willing to donate the sum of Million US Dollars to your for the of and also as aids for the less around you. 
  
Please note that, this fund is lying in a Security Company in Europe and the company has my lawyer will file an immediate for the transfer of the money in the name of your ministry. Please, do not reply me if you have the intention of using this fund for personal use,than of  
  
Lastly, I want you/your ministry to be praying for me as regards my entire life and my health because I have come to find out since my spiritual birth lately that wealth without Jesus Christ in one's life is vanity upon vanity.If you have to die says The Lord, keep fit and I will give you the whole of my life. May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God and the sweet of the Holy Spirit be with you. 
  
I awaits your urgent reply. 
  
YOURS IN CHRIST,

patience in other to its content properly. 
 
I learnt that many Africans has used the advantage of what happened to us in  
my country to deceive some innocent souls and may be some has even used my  
fathers name because of his and what we all need  
to in this world is that everybody will answer for him or herself  
on the last day. 
 
My name is Mr and i am the only son of my parents. Myfather is  
Mr Johnson Koni and my mother is mrs I am a graduate of federal  
of science and and my is

as his father has two big farms that are well known in Zimbabwe  
and has many workers that were working for him. 
 
I managed my fathers farms for two years before we had in my country.I got  
your contact through network online decided to write you to explain my  
situation and request for your 
 
This crises was as a result of a new land Act reform by president  
Robert Mugabe which wholly affected most white farmers and few black

veterans and some lunatics in the a lot of people were killed  
because of this land reform act of which my father was a victim. 
 
But before the death of my father,  as if he knew he was going to die  
informed me about the money he deposited with a security and finance firm in  
South total amount is twenty three hundred thousand  
POUNDS and this money was deposited in a box as germ  
stones to avoid much demurrage from the Security and finance firm. This  
amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the  
farms and of a new farm in 
 
One month after my father's death,I and my mother decided to travell to  
South Africa for our lives and decided to look for a foreigner  
who will help us to transfer this money out of South Africa 
because we are staying as refugees here in South Africa and refugees are not  
alowed to open bank accounts or involved in any financial in  
South Africa.I have all the documents 
this money and what i am seeking for is a genuine foreign account where this  
money could be into without the knowledge of my who  
are bent on that belongs to my father.

my future and that of my family . I must also let you know that this  
is 100%risk free. If you accept to assist 
me and my family all I want from you is for you to make and  
come to  South Africa, so that you can help me open a  
account in your name which will aid us in the money  
into any account you will nominate overseas.

your account for this Or you can 
go into with me for the proper of the  
money in your country. Which ever the option you free to notify

Dear Friend, 
 
I am MR FRED KUMA, the director in charge of auditing and 
section of Trust Bank cotonou republic of benin in west Africa 
with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a business 
that will be very to both of  us at the end of the 
. 
 
During our and auditing in this bank,my came 
across a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in 
a plane crash on the 26th December 1998 on airline 
with aircraft Lockheed L-100-30 at location Vila 
with number S9-CAO and since his untimely death the funds has 
been dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in 
our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to this 

Although I keep this secret within myself and 
partners to enable the whole plans and idea be and 
during the time of The said amount was US$24.1M 
(Twenty Four million One Hundred Thousand united states dollars). 
 
As it may interest you to know, I got your

capable to champion a business of such magnitude without any problem.

this money to a foreign account has been put in place and and 
needed will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your 
interest and to assist us and also benefit yourself to this 
great business 
 
In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in 
this country as a civil  are not allowed to operate a foreign 
account and would raise an eye brow on my side during the time 
of transfer because I work in this bank. This is the actual reason why it 
will require a second party or fellow who will forward claims as the next 
of kin to the Bank and also present a foreign account where he will need 
the money to be into on his request as it may be after due 
and by the branch of the bank 
where the whole money will be remitted from to your own bank 
account. 
 
May I at this point emphasize that this is 100% risk free as I 
have made for a as an insider of the 
bank before you.  On smooth of this you 
will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as while 10% will 
be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of 
transfer and also telephone bills, while 60% will be for me and my partners. 
 
Please, you have been adviced to keep this a top secret as we are still in 
service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with 
you. 
 
I will be the whole situation here in this bank until you 
confirm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country 
for sharing of the fund according to 
indicated and further either in your country or any country you 
advice us to invest in. 
 
All other necessary will be sent to you on your to 
champion this with me.

phone 229 08 69 05 stating your wish in this deal. 
 
Yours

Good Day, 
 
With warm heart I offer my and my 
and I hope this letter meets you in good time. It will 
be to you to receive this proposal from me 
since you do not know me 
However, I am sincerely seeking your in this 
which I propose with my free mind and as a 
person of 
 
My name is Wolny Olkusz, the first son of Paul Olkusz, 
of the most popular black farmer from Zimbabwe, murdered 
in the land dispute in my country. As led by my instict, 
I decided to contact you through email, after searching 
for contacts via the internet, as it is the only means 
I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with 
Zimbabwe for security and safety reasons. 
 
However, I apologize if this is not to you. The 
purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed 
in a business venture. Due to the land and 
political problems in Zimbabwe, as a result of President 
Robert Mugabe's of new Land Act Reform wholly 
affecting the rich white farmers and the few rich black 
farmers, and his desire to hold on to power for life, my 
father for saw the danger that came in Zimbabwe. 
 
Before he was murdered, he withdrew all of our business 
foreign accounts in dollars and sold up our shares in 
major We then went to SOUTH AFRICA to deposit 
the sum of US$14.5 million (Fourteen million, Five Hundred 
thousand US dollars), in a private security company. This 
money was deposited with this Private Security company for 
safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the 
purchase of land, new machines and chemicals 
of new farms in Europe. President Mugabe's support for the violent 
war veterans and some lunatics in the society, led to the 
murder of my beloved father and other innocent lives. 
 
I was to abandon my from 
my father after he was murdered. I resited for a while, but 
when the danger became and I survived two murder 
attempts, I fled Zimbabwe. I am currently staying in the 
Holland where I am seeking political asylum. In fact my 
decision to come here to seek asylum, is because the security 
company from South Africa, has a branch holland and they 
have moved the deposit from their office in down here. 
 
I need to transfer this money to an account and invest part 
of the money. Since the law of prohibits a refugee 
(asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved 
in any financial this is why I am seeking a 
genuine and reliable partner, whose account this money can 
be hence this proposal to you.You have to 
that this decision taken by me entrusts my future 
and in your hands, as a result of the safe keeping of this money. 
 
If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is 
to assist with to claim the deposit from the 
security company from their office in 
as it has now been from South Africa 
to their branch here. The company will be legally informed of you 
me. For your I have two options for you. 
 
Firstly you can choose to have 10% of the money for your 
and helping me open an account for the money 
to be deposited here, or you can go into with 
me for the proper of the money in your country. 
Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in your reply. I 
have also set aside of this money for all kinds of 
expenses that come our way in the process of this and 4% 
for Charity donation. 
 
If you prefer to accept the 10or assisting with opening an 
account, 
then 85%will be left in the account here for me. Please, I want 
you 
maintain the absolute secrecy for the purpose of this 
I look forward to your reply and and I thank you 
in 
advance as I your can reach me on my 
direct line which is  or via email, 

Wolny Olkusz.

email: 
 
Kindest I am very sorry for the informal 
manner in which this mail is reaching you. This is 
by my urgent need to reach a 
and foreign partner. This request may seem 
strange and but I crave your 
and pray that you take my request very serious.I am 
Mr. Joseph Rodney Chesson, the first son of Late J. J. 
F. Chesson (Liberian Minister of Justice 1979 to 
1980). On April 22, 1980, my father along with 12 
other Liberian officials was 
as a result of a military coup that toppled the 
of President William R. Tolbert, Jr. May 
his soul rest in Eternal Peace. Since then, my family 
has always been seen as a symbol of peace in Liberia. 
You can view our family web page below;  

but please do not call me  
on the tel/fax number below as the number is presumed 
bugged by the 
 
I received from a reliable source that 
described your country as being conducive 
for and her people as and 
to engaging business, which made me to 
write you. As you may want to know and to make you 
less curious, I got your email address from an 
Internet site that portrayed you in good light.  
Early this year, Liberia rebels agitated for the 
removal of 
President Charles Taylor, who portrayed a very good 
example of a bad leader. The President who needed 
support from prominent Liberia citizen gave me the sum 
of million United States Dollars (US$ 
28M) cash (stalked in two trunk boxes) as 
for my late father and solicited for my support. I 
quickly made an with a courier company 
here in Monrovia and moved the to an asset 
company in  
the uk. I did not support 
President Charles Taylor because my is not 
for sale. Some months later heavy fight broke up in 
Liberia, he placed all the eligible members of my 
family under travel all our 
traveling documents and frozen all our account in 
Liberia. Later in July, foreign troops invaded Liberia 
and different peace keeping meetings were held and 
President Taylor was advised to step down for national 
peace. On the 11th August 2003 President Charles 
Taylor flied into exile but the problem we are having 
now is that he handed over power to his 
Moses Blah who is more wicked and He was 
the person that Taylor to all 
our traveling documents and frozen all our account in 
Liberia. That is why I requested for your sincere 
pending when a fresh election will be held 
here. The main rebel faction Liberians United for 
and Democracy (LURD) has vowed to 
continue its war if Taylor hands over to Blah. The 
rebels are not happy with the above so 
they still continued fighting.  
 
WHAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DO FOR US:I will transfer the 
ownership of the /boxes the 
cash to you and issue you a power of attorney through 
my Lawyer. With these document you will lay claims to 
the money as my proxy from the company in europe. 
 
The entire operation is risk free since it is only you 
and me and my Lawyer that knows the details of the 
money after you must have taken the money to your 
country where it is save my lawyer will then meet you 
in your country to use my share of the money for 
Bearing in mind that your is 
needed to transfer this fund, I propose a 
of 20% (twenty percent) of the total sum to you for 
the expected services and Your private fax 
and telephone numbers are needed to enhance the speedy 
of this (our only hope in life 
now) urgently. Your urgent response via the above 
email address is highly needed so as to stop further 
contact. I must use this to implore you to 
exercise the utmost to keep this matter 
extra whatever your decision 
while I await your prompt response. Our phone line 
both home and abroad are bugged. So don’t call me. I 
will always call you at my time and in a 
conducive PLS REPLY TO

this account again. After going through some old files 
in the records, I that the owner of the 
account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money is 
floating and  if I do not remit this money out 
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. The owner 
of this account is  Mr. Phillip Morris, a

and  no other person knows about this account or any

a foreigner because this money cannot be approved to 
a local person here without a valid 
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any 
foreigner with valid passport or drivers 
license and foreign a/c  because the money is in US 
dollars and the former owner of the  a/c, Mr. Phillip Morris was a foreigner too, [and the money can only 
be approved into a foreign a/c]. 
 
However, we will sign a binding agreement to bind us 
together. I got your contact address  from the girl 
who operates computer. I am revealing this to you 
with belief in God that you will never let me down in 
this business. You are the first and the only person 
that I am for this business, so please 
reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step 
to take . Send also your private telephone and 
fax number including the full details of the account 
to be used for the deposit.

to sign a binding agreement that will bind us 
together before the money to any account 
of  your choice  where the fund will be safe. Then, 
we fly to your country for sharing and

because the is ready to approve this

FROM MISS ZAINAB UBA AND HER BROTHER 
ABIDJAN, IVORY COAST 
WEST AFRICA. 
 
ATTN , 
 
It is my pleasure to write you after my seven days fasting and prayers and  
much since I can not be able to see you face to face at first. 
 
Being the first and the only Daughter of my father, late ALHAJI KALWA UBA from 
 BETE in Republic of COTE D´IVOIRE Africa I am 21years of age. My  
father was limited liability cocoa and gold merchant in ABIDJAN before his  
untimely death after his business trip to to negotiate on a  
cocoa business. A week after he came back from SWISS, he was  
with my mother by unknown  
 
Which my mother died, but my father died after five days in  
hospital, on that faithful I didn´t know that my father was  
going to leave me after I had lost my mother. But 
before he gave up the ghost, it was as if he knew he was going to die. He  
my father, (may his soul rest in perfect peace) he disclose to me that he  
deposited the sum of $5 million U.S dollars in a PRIVATE BANK here in  
ABIDJAN. That the money was meant for his cocoa business he wanted to  
invest in Abidjan - Côte d´Ivoire. Though, according to my father he  
deposited the money in his own name .  
 
He single handed me over the document and logging and verifying  
, and me to seek for a life time partner  
abroad.  
 
Now I have succeeded in locating the BANK in here and also confirmed the  
fund is in there , most honest and Now I am for  
your to help me lift this money out from The BANK to your  
account abroad so that we should invest it in any lucrative business in  
your country.  
 
I am Waiting anxiously to hear from you so that we can discuss the  
of this  
 
Thanks for your kind attention and mutual 

Best regards 
 
ZAINAB.

Dear Friend, 
My name is JANG DOO-HWAN, The brother of Mr. CHUN 
DOO-HWAN, the former President of South Korea who 
seized power in a military coup in 1979 and who ruled 
from 1979 to 1987. My brother was pushed out of office 
and charged with treason, and 
of over 21 billion won. He was wrongly sentenced to 
death but AMNESTY stepped in 
and commuted the sentence to life. We thank God that 
he has finally been released though still under house 
arrest in the sense of the of his freedom. 
During my brother's regime as president of South 
Korea, we realized some amount of money 
from various deals that we executed. I 
have plans to invest this money for my 
future in real estate and 
Before my brother was I secretly 
siphoned the sum of Million USD (Twenty 
Million United States dollars) out of Seoul and 
deposited the money with a Security Firm that 
valuable goods and through 
means. 
I am you because I want you to deal with 
the Security Firm and claim the money on my behalf 
since I have declared that the belong to 
my Foreign Business Partner. You shall also be 
required to assist me in in your country. 
I hope to trust you as a God fearing person who will 
not sit on this money when you claim it, rather you 
would assist me properly. 
I intend to give you 20% of the total money if you can  
assist me claim these from the security I 
receive your positive response I will let you know where  
the Security Firm is and the Payment Pin Code to claim  
the money which is very What I need is for you  
to indicate your interest that you will assist me by  
receiving the money on my behalf in Europe. For this, you  
shall be to be the of the money.  
The project in brief, is that the funds with which we intend  
to carry out our proposed in your country, is  
presently in the custody of a Courier Service Company 
in Europe. 
I cannot do this myself because I am presently living 
in a Western European Country and my Status here is 
that of a Political Refugee and moreover I do not want 
the of my Country to know about 
the money because they will believe I got the money 
from my brother while he was still in office as 
Once you confirm the receipt of the money, 
I would leave where I am presently located and come 
over with my Children to your Country to start a new 
life with my Family. 
As soon as payment is effected, and the amount 
mentioned above is into your 
account, I intend to use my own share in acquiring 
some estates in your country. For this purpose also, 
you shall be my project manager for the I 
hope to acquire in your country and you will be paid 
based on a certain agreed upon by both of 
us. 
For now, let all our be by e-mail 
because of the nature of this but for more 
details on this you can contact my lawyer 
(Bar Harry Fenadez) on this tel number 
It is very important you contact him because he will be 
the one to represent me in all legal matters to back this 
pending since i cannot move at the momemt.  
Please send me your Telephone and Fax numbers as it 
would be better for me to get to you now by any of 
this means. This would be for our better peace of mind 
before and after these funds are into your 
account. 
The reason why it took this long to get to you was 
because of the Security Firm's agreement with me which 
was that my brother must sign the Power of 
Attorney that would transfer title to the 
It was a long wait but it has now paid 
off. His Chun Doo-Hwan does not want to be 
involved for security and personal reasons. 
Your quick response will be highly Thank 
you in of your

Following my of owning an offshore 
I was urged to  contact a foreigner  
to assist in the  immediate release  
of United States Dollars into his/her bank 
account to jointly execute my motive of securing  
an offshore  This was because Nigeria's  
civil service code of conduct does  not allow a civil  
servant to own an offshore account or 
outside the shores of Nigeria. 
 
Sequel to this, I was able to contact a foreigner (Mr. 
Jim Walsh) an American based in Nigeria to assist  
with the transfer.  He agreed and we  proceeded  
in procuring all documents necessary to  the  
immediate release of the funds into his custody using 
him as a Project to the Nigerian  

The money was as a result of an contract 
on contract  number for the  
supply  and of  
equipment to Nitel regional offices 
up to the tune of United States Dollars.  
It was awarded to a  Swiss who executed  
the contract and was fully paid i.e United  
States Dollars leaving aside United States 
Dollars. 
 
Final payment approval was granted on behalf of Mr. 
Jim Walsh by the Federal Ministry of Finance (FMF)  
to the paying bank while waiting for the payment  
from him to the bank but he 
suddenly died of Cardiac Arrest leaving no  
Next of to the funds. 
 
It is as a result of this, that I am  
you to  please stand as the next of kin to Mr.  
Jim Walsh and new  to the funds to  
enable the funds to be into your custody. 
All documents to back up your claim will be giving  
to you  while a of  
(MOU) will be reached between us to safe 
guard our both interest in line of this 
 
I am willing to you with 25% of the total 
funds while the rest 75% will be for me for the  
in your country as well as assuring  
you that this is 100% risk free 
and legal. 
 
If this proposal is okay to you, please kindly get 
back to me to enable  me demand certain  
and briefing for the of this 
 
Please always quote the reference number above in all 
to me while should be  
our watch word.

When I now asked them what they intended to do now that my committee has this USD19.2M. They begged me not to disclose this to the as they will likely lose their jobs and their family names  
 
I was at at a as I did not want my friends to suffer for what other top officials do and get away with. I discussed with the other two members of my committee and we all agreed to transfer this fund out and share amongst

My dear friend,  
 
I am DR. Yetunde Bassey, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Branch. I have urgent and very business for you.  
 
On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil with the Nigerian National Petroleum Mr. Roger  Scott made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch.  
 
Upon maturity, I sent a routine to his address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we from his contract the Nigerian National Petroleum that Mr. Roger  Scott died from an  
accident.  
 
On further I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was I therefore made further and that Mr. Roger  Scott did not declare any kin or relations in all his official including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  
 
This sum of is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.  
 
According to Nigerian Law, at the of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian if nobody applies to claim the fund.  
 
my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Roger  Scott that the fruits of this old labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt  
 
This is simple, I will like you to provide your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of in your favor for the transfer. 
 
A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then the transfer of this money to you as the of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds arrive your country.  
 
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager the execution of this If you are please reply ONLY via any of my alternate private email addresses below otherwise I would not respond to you.  
 
Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you the

This fund emanated as a result of an contract which he executed with the of South Africa. Though I assisted him in getting this contract but I never knew that it was by him. I am afraid that the of South Africa might start to on contracts awarded from 1990 to date.If they discover this money in his bank account, they will it and seize his assets here in South Africa and this will affect my political career in

I am Mr. J. Rodney Chesson, the first son of Late J. J. F. Chesson (Liberian Minister of Justice 1979 to 1980). On April 22, 1980, my father along with 12 other Liberian officials was as a result of a military coup that toppled the of President William 
R. Tolbert, Jr. May his soul rest in Eternal Peace. Since then, my family has always been seen as a symbol of peace in Liberia.  
 
I received from a reliable source that described your country as being conducive for and her people as and to engaging business, which made me to write you. As you may want to know and to make you less curious, I got your email address from an Internet site that portrayed you in good light. 
 
Early this year, Liberia rebels agitated for the removal of President Charles Taylor, who portrayed a very good example of a bad leader. The President who needed support from prominent Liberia citizen gave me the sum of million United States Dollars (US$ 28M) cash (stalked in two trunk boxes) as for my late father and solicited for my support.  
 
I quickly made an with a courier company here in Monrovia and moved the to an asset company in Europe. I did not support President Charles Taylor because my is not for sale. Some months later heavy fight broke up in Liberia, he placed all the eligible members of my family under travel watch all our traveling documents and frozen all our account in Liberia. Later in July, foreign troops invaded Liberia and different peace keeping meetings were held and President Taylor was advised to step down for national peace. On the 11th August 2003 President Charles Taylor flied into exile and handed over power to his Moses Blah who is even more wicked and He was the person that Taylor to all our traveling documents and frozen all our account in Liberia. On Tuesday 14th October 2003, Gyude Bryant took office in Liberia as the head of an interim Bryant, 54 was by picked b! 
 y the warring factions and this step has offered Liberia a new chance to end nearly 14 years of violence. My lawyer him as regards releasing our traveling documents and the embargo on our bank accounts but he declined and told us that his priority is disarm fighters and pave the way for elections that is why I requested for your sincere pending when a fresh election will be held here.  
 
WHAT YOU ARE EXPECTED TO DO FOR US:  
 
I will transfer the ownership of the /boxes the cash to you and issue you a power of attorney through my Lawyer. With these document you will claims to the money as my proxy from the asset company in Europe. The entire operation is risk free since it is only you and me and my Lawyer that knows the details of the money after you must have taken the money to your country where it is save my lawyer will then meet you in your country to use my share of the money for Bearing in mind that your is needed to transfer this fund, I propose a of 20% (twenty percent) of the total sum to you for the expected services and

Your urgent response via the above email address is highly needed so as to stop further contact. I must use this to implore you to exercise the utmost to keep this matter extra whatever your decision while I await your prompt response. Our phone line both home and abroad are bugged.

PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USED IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD. 
I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married 
to Dr. Harry Jones who worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Co 
ast for nine years before he died in the year 
2000. 
We were married for eleven years without a child. He died a 
fter a brief illness that lasted for only 
four days. Before his death we were both born again Christia 
ns.Since his death I decided not to re- 
marry or get a child outside my home which the Bi 
ble is my late husband was alive he deposited the 
sum (Eight Million six hundred thousand U.S. D 
ollars) with one company in Hollan 
d. this money is still with the Security Company. 
Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next 
three 
months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most i 
s my stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to 
donate this fund to church or better still a christian individ 
ual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruc 
t here in. I want a church that will use this fund to fund chu 
rches, and widows the word of God and t 
o ensure that the house of God is The Bible made 
us to that Blessed is the hand that giveth. 
I took this decision because I don?t have any child that wil 
l inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christi 
ans and I don?t want my husband?s hard earned money to be misu 
sed by I don?t want a situation where this money 
will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking 
this bold decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know whe 
re I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of th 
e Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case 
and I shall hold my peace. I don?t need any telephone communi 
cation in this regard because of my health because of the pres 
ence of my husband?s relatives around me always. I don?t want 
them to know about this With God all things are p 
ossible. As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the 
contact of the Company in Holland 
. I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove 
you as the original- 
of this fund. I want you and the church to always 
pray for me because the lord is my shephard. My 
happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Whoe 
ver that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and 
truth. Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any d 
elay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a chuch 
or christian for this same purpose. Please assure 
me that you will act as I stated herein. Hoping 
to hearing from you.

Dear friend,  
 
I am Mrs. Sese-seko widow of late President Mobutu  
Sese-seko of Zaire, now known as Republic  
of Congo (DRC). I am moved to write you this  
letter. This was in my present  
and I escaped along with my  
husband and two of our sons Joseph and Basher out of  
Republic of Congo (DRC) to Abidjan, Cote  
d'ivoire where my family and I settled, while we later  
moved to settled in Morroco where my husband later  
died of cancer disease.  
 
However, due to this situation we decided to change  
most of my husband's billions of dollars deposited in  
Swiss bank and other countries into other forms of  
money coded for safe purpose because the new head of  
state of (Dr) Mr Laurent Kabila has made  
with the Swiss and other European countries  
to freeze all my late husband's treasures deposited in  
some european Hence, my children and I  
decided laying low in Africa to study the situation  
till when things gets better. Like now that  
president Kabila is dead and the son taking over  
(Joseph Kabila). One of my late husband's chateaux in  
Southern France was by the french  
and as such I had to change my identity so  
that my will not be traced and  
I have deposited the sum Fourteen Million United State  
Dollars With a security company  
for safe keeping. What I want you to do is to indicate  
your interest that you can assist us in receiving the  
money on our behalf, so that I can introduce you to my  
son (Joseph) who has the out for the claim  
of the said funds. I want you to assist in investing  
this money, but I will not want my identity revealed.  
I will also want to acquire and  
stock in companies and to engage in  
other safe and as advise  
by your good self.  
 
May I at this point emphasize the high level of  
which this upcoming project demands,  
and hope you will not betray the trust and  
which I repose in you.In if  
you want to assist us, my son (Joseph) shall divulge  
to you all briefs regarding this project, tell you where  
the funds are currently being and also  
discuss for your this reason  
kindly furnish us your contact is  
your personal telephone and fax number for  
purpose and receipt of this mail using the

Dear Friend, 
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for 
me, because, I believe everyone will die someday. 
My name is Dada Abu,a 74years old the 
U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with cancer 
which was very late, due to my laxity in 
caring for my health. It has defiled all forms of 
medicine, and right now I have only about a few months 
to live, according to medical experts. 
I have not lived my life so well, as I 
never really cared for anyone not even myself but my 
business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, 
I was always hostile to people and only focus on my 
business as that was the only thing I cared for. But 
now I regret all this as I now know that there is more 
to life than just wanting to have or make all the 
money in the world. 
I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to 
this world I would live my life a different way from 
how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I 
have willed and given most of my and assets 
to my immediate and extended family members and as 
well as a few close friends. 
I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and 
so, I have decided to give alms to charity 
as I want this to be one of the last 
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have 
money to some charity in the 
and Malaysia. Now that my health has 
so badly, I cannot do this my self any 
more. I once asked members of my family to close one 
of my accounts and the money which I have 
there to charity in Bulgaria and 
Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to 
Hence, I do not trust them anymore , as 
they seem not to be with what I have left 
for them. 
The last of my money which no one knows about other 
than my distant relative who is presently in the 
is the huge cash deposit of 8 million 
dollars that I have with a security company in 

I will want you to help me collect this deposit with 
the of my relative and dispatch it to 
charity you are 
email my cousin at: 
Yours Truly 
Mr.Dada Abu.

My dear friend,  
 
I am Mr. Yetunde Bassey, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Branch. I have urgent and very business for you.  
 
On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil with the Nigerian National Petroleum Mr. Roger Scott made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch.  
 
Upon maturity, I sent a routine to his address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we from his contract the Nigerian National Petroleum that Mr. Roger Scott made died from an  
accident.  
 
On further I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was I therefore made further and that Mr. Roger Scott made did not declare any kin or relations in all his official including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  
 
This sum of is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.  
 
According to Nigerian Law, at the of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian if nobody applies to claim the fund.  
 
my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Roger Scott  so that the fruits of this old labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt  
 
This is simple, I will like you to provide your full names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of in your favor for the transfer. 
 
A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will then the transfer of this money to you as the of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds arrive your country.  
 
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this will be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager the execution of this If you are please reply ONLY via any of my alternate private email addresses below otherwise I would not respond to you.  
 
Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you the 
  
Please observe utmost and rest assured that this would be most for both of us because I shall require your to invest my share in your country. I look forward to hearing from you soonest. 
 
Thanks and regards.

His name is Late Mr Saud Ed Abad AlKharj, he was survived by a fiance and a son from her as they intended getting married but where trying to be cautious because of Islamic law attitude on adultery. This were his only family and no next of kin, as he was the only child of Late Sheikh Hamza Al Kharj Al Faisal, who received royalties from the Kuwaiti on one of his fields which oil was and explored (the Al Jazriah Oil Field). 
  
All to find a next of kin was privately conducted by me and was futile. It was at this juncture that I and other officials Managing his portfolio and 2 bank managers where he had his accounts now  
decided to make this proposal and transfer ownership of the portfolio to an Agreeing party as to the portfolio of the deceased. 
  
The reason why ownership cannot be to his wife to be and only son is that Islamic law will not recognize such and if an attempt is made on that it may put her in trouble with the for giving birth outside  
marriage. So we have decided to help her by making this proposal and making sure she gets a part of Late Mr Saud Alkharj’s property for her

All records and accounts regarding the assets of deceased were managed by me for 10 years running, if you are to assist us, all I will do is to in the old records  
you as the only 
  
The banking law here that if such portfolio remains unclaimed after four years it will go to the public The need for a foreigner as is by the fact that the deceased was not  
resident in 
  
For your we made up of I, 2 senior directors in my firm and 2 bank managers in banks which the Kuwaiti pay accruing to the deceased have agreed in fairness to make available 25% of all bank  
funds cleared and 15% of the royalties which you will continue to receive on behalf of the deceased as sole every year. However we do not intend to share any interest with you as far as the estates and property are

I am Mr.Kazeem Ahmed,the Chairman of ECOWAS contract awarding committee in 
ecowas head quarter in Accra Ghana, West Africa. In due respect 
and 
regard, I have decided to contact you on a business that will be 
very to both of us 
at the end of the During our and auditing in my 
a huge sum of money that was over invoiced 
amounting and for in the books of 
that it has been floating since 1997 through 2001 in 

Bank of Africa Accra Ghana. this is found out to be over influence on 
contract 
payments and over invoice. the is kept secret by me 
and 
my partner to enable the whole plan and ideas and 
during 
the time of As it may interest you to know, I got your contact 
through business inquires from the  chamber of commerce here in my country 
as I 
was making contact for an honest foreigner who will assist me in this 

Meanwhile the whole to put claim over this fund, as a payment 
of 
contract executed since it cannot be withdrawn locally and get the required 
approval and transfer this money to a foreign account 
has been put in place and and needed will be relayed 
to 
you as soon as you indicate your interest and to assits us and 
also 
benefit yourself in this great business 
In fact I could have done this alone but because of my position 
in 
this country as a civil servant we are not allowed to operate a foreign 
account 
and would raise an eyebrow on my 
side during the time of transfer. This is the actual reason why it will 
require 
a second party or fellow, who will forward claim as the 
and also present a foreign account where the money would be 
to as a payment for contract executed as it may be after due 
by board.  I would not fail to inform you that this 
is 100% On smooth of this 
you would be entitlled to 30% as 5% will be 
set 
aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time of transfer 
and 
also telephone bills, while 65% will be for me and 
my partners. 
Please, you have been advise to keep as we are still in service 
and 
intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I will

I got your contact from the Internet and I do believe you can 
help me. 
 
I am you due to the present situation as regards the 
manner the present in my country

family in his bid to recover all our money because my Husband is 
dead. 
 
They have brought up charges of corrupt against us. 
he is currently facing same from the National 
Assembly right now. I pray he does not get an The 
law they made is yet another smear campaign aimed mainly to 
dismember and widen the scope of hatred for 
my family. A personal vendetta by President Obasanjo who was 
jailed by my husband's for plotting a coup d 'etat 
against his in 1995. 
 
This highly attempt by this plus some 
Western Banks through has taken away from 
us a whopping amount in and Bank accounts around the 
World. This rampaging of our Bank accounts abroad have yielded to 
the barbaric pressure and just few months ago we were squized 
out of another US$395m because the accounts bear our names. This 
can be if you wish to 
confirm this from a leading newspaper in Nigeria (This Day from 
their website at from the archives section in the 
March 10,2001, January 26,2002 and March 18, 2002 editions. 
 
This pressure is taking a great toll on my family and all we ever 
owe. You may be aware that my surviving eldest son 
was undully detained without trial untill thursday 11TH of July 
2002 one year now that the Supreme Court of Nigeria Ordered his 
release and cleared him of any wrong doing as he has been 
in prison for the past three and half years. It was on Monday 
23RD September last year that he was finally released to us. 
 
Please we wish to solicit your as a foreigner to help 
us receive some family property / (Money) Deposited with a

intend to put in your care by getting a trusted foreigner to 
handle money for the purpose of and abroad.

This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and of new farms in This land problem came when President Mr. Robert Mugabe a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black Farmers and this resulted to the killing and mob action by war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father " Mudada Abba " was one of the victims. It is against this back 
round that, I and my Mother and three   younger ones fled Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and I currently staying in the in a village called Zwolle, where my family are seeking political asylum and more so I have decided to transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account.

The South African seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for fear of going through the same in future, both countries have similar political history.

If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is to make an with the security company to clear the (funds) from their affiliate office here in the as I have already given for the to be brought to the from South before then all will have to be put in place like change of ownership to the and more this money I intend to use for I have two options for you.

Dear 
 
		HIGHLY 

This letter may come to you as a surprise but I plead 
with you to patiently read through it before making a 
decision whether to assist me or not. 
 
I wish to solicit for your in this 
which I strongly believe, will be of 
mutual benefit to both of us. 
 
My name is DAVIS TUTU, a branch manger of a 
leading bank in South Africa (ABSA Bank), my 
and I wish to seek your in the 
transfer of some huge sum of money (USD$35M) into a 
foreign bank account. 
 
An American national deposited this money in a fixed 
deposit account in the bank, six years ago. The length 
of time for the maturity of the fixed deposit was five 
years, which expired towards the ending of last year. 
MR. JEFF STEVENS, who was the 
died in the September 11th bombing of the 
World Trade Center in America, and he left MR DAVID 
STEVENS as the to claim this money, but 
he was said to have died of cancer few months after 
Jeff's death. All efforts made to trace any known 
relations of both proved abortive, and no one has 
written our bank in this regard. 
 
All for the transfer of this 
money into an offshore bank account have been put in 
place and we are looking for a trust worthy foreign 
partner into whose bank account this fund would be 
remitted to and it is in this regard that my 
have mandated me to provide a partner who 
will assist us. We have agreed to you with 
20% of the total amount if you should accept to assist 
us. 
 
If you are in giving us the required 
kindly reply this letter stating your 
numbers for further action. Because of 
the secrecy this I suggest 
that you send a fax me or call and i will contact you 
for futher details. 
 
I am looking forward to a favorable reply from you 
soon. Feel free to ask any question in this regard. 
 
I remain, 
 
Yours 
 
Davis Tutu

I am Dr. Usman ali, I am a former special 
Adviser on Petroleum matters to the late Head of State 
Of Nigeria Gen. Sani Abacha. Because of my strategic 
Position in the former and also being a 
Close confidant of the late Head of State. 
 
I was able to acquire the sum of 
USD (Twelve Million, Five Hundred 
Thousand United States Dollars only) presently lodged 
In Security Company inform of Gold Bars in a security 
company here in Nigeria. I did not want the 
of the Security Company to know the content of the 
therefore I the content of 
the as Gold Bars. Now, the security 
company believes that what I deposited with them was 
Gold Bars 
I made this money largely through FEE" 
And "Good Faith Fees" paid by foreign Oil companies 
Prior to of Deep Water Oil Blocs and other 
Rights (Nigeria is the 6th largest 
of Crude Petroleum in the World. 
As you are probably aware Nigeria is prone to Military 
Coups and the resultant 
has fueled hyper amongst other problems. 
 
I have therefore resolved to invest my money abroad, 
in Real Estate and 
of Goods from your country for safety and optimum 
returns on 
 
However, straight transfer of this money into a bank 
abroad will present two major problems one, the tax 
incidence will be too high, as much as 60% of this 
money will go up in Taxes, Levies, Penalties etc. as a 
result of on flight 
of capital Abroad. And also been accused of money 
 
and The solution is to Courier this money 
cash abroad in form of through Courier 
service Company here in Nigeria in 
with an embassy here in Nigeria, the money 
will be packed in a tagged 
luggage that will be address to you. 
 
This system is secret and the money is therefore 
It is system used by most top 
officials to remove their fortunes to safety abroad. 
I have therefore concluded every with a 
Courier Company in Nigeria to Courier this money 
abroad using the courtesy and safety of 
Bag. All I now need is an honest partner who can 
receive the money on my behalf and help me to invest 
as There is no risk 
involved in this as the money will be 
delivered to you in United States Dollars Bills. 
 
If you are in assisting me, please send to 
me by email your preferred contact address 
where this money will be delivered to you, upon 
delivery, you are to lodge this money in a bank 
account and contact me for necessary for 
the 
For your help and in this deal, you will 
receive 15% of this money in cash or Equity if you 
wish to join the proposed company. 
 
I have notified the Security Company where I deposited 
the that contained the fund, that I am 
moving the abroad and the security company 
has since been waiting for my authority for the 
to leave my country and move to abroad. 
So if you know that you will use this fund honestly as 
I have 
 
and the details will be given to you on how you will 
be able to receive the fund in your country through 
the security company. You should also forward to me 
your telephone and fax number for easy

TAYLOR 
 
Goodday, 
 
I am Joseph vaye,the son of late Issac Nuhan Vaye, deputy minister of public 
 
works under President charles taylor of Liberia. 
 
Before the political upheaval in liberia my late father was a good and 
close  
friend of president 
charles taylor and a member of his inner of late when liberia 
 
crisis came up the rebels trying to oust charles taylor out 
of  
and charles taylor became very 
 
with some of his loyalists which my late father happened to be one of them 
 
because he had the believe that at the rate at which the rebel group was 
  
closing in on him in is the seat of power)was as a result 
of  
the leakage of some vital security  from his cabinet and he 
 
decided to eliminate some of his cabinet members which my father happened 
to  
be a victim. 
 
It started in the name of an uncovered coup and he ordered the arrest of 
 
some of his cabinet ministers 
and the Vice President Moses Blah on the 5th of june which my father was 
 
included and some days later we learnt about my father's death alongside 
 
with John Winpoe Yormie, deputy minister of national security. 
 
My mother and i actually knew why my father was murdered because before 
the  
political mayhem in 
late father  and President charles taylor have a 
good  
and he has 
assisted him in lodging funds from the sales of diamond in different banks 
 
and security companies which my late father also benefited from it until 
at  
the wake of war in liberia my father was not getting along with 
 
President Charles taylor because of his tyranic law which created a breach 
 
in their and with the alarming rate at which the rebels are 
 
advancing into Monrovia to unseat President charles taylor he was no longer 
 
sure of  some of his cabinet members and decided to eliminate 
them under the disguise that they were coup plotters 
 
Before the death of my father, at the peak of his with  
president charles taylor,he was able 
to some funds he deposited 
 
with a security company in Ghana from the deals he did for the 
 
Basically my mother and i require a person that can assist 
us to  
retrieve our funds from the 
security company in has been very unstable for us(my mum,my 
 
youngers ones and i) and i would not want to bore you with all we went 
 
through but for the sake of my late fathers death. All the necessary  
documents for the deposit are in my I am now a refugee in  
african country Ghana due to the fear of been killed by  
president charles taylor and the unrest in Liberia. 
 
the president of Nigeria  has agreed to grant  president charles 
 
taylor assylum in Nigeria in 
order to restore peace in liberia so we are trying to do all  we can at 
 
earnest to retrieve the funds from 
the security company and leave West Africa before he comes to 
 
Nigeria. 
 
Upon your response to this mail,i will intimate you on how we can proceed 
to  
get the funds from the security company. 
 
Best regards, 
 
Joseph

Dear Sir, 
 
I am Mr Kalada Hart, Bank Manager of Orient Bank of Nigeria, 
Lagos Branch. I have an urgent and very business  
for you. 
 
On September 6, 1997, a Canadian Oil with  
the Nigerian National Petroleum Mr. Jerry Sheldon 
 made a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months,  
valued at (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch.  
Upon maturity, I sent a routine to his  
address but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and  
finally we from his contract the Nigerian  
National Petroleum that Mr. Jerry Sheldon died from  
an accident. On further I found out that  
he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next  
of kin was 
 
I therefore made further and that  
Mr. Jerry Sheldon did not declare any kin or relations in all his  
official including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.  
This sum of is still sitting in my Bank and the  
interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each  
year. No one has ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian  
Law, at the of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the  
ownership of the Nigerian if nobody applies to claim the fund. 
 
my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as the  
next of kin to Mr. Jerry Sheldon so that the fruits of this old man's  
labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt official 
s. This is simple, I will like you to provide your full  
names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary  
documents and which will put you in place as the next of kin.  
We shall employ the service of two Attorney for drafting and  
of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/ 
in your favor for the transfer.  
A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then  
the transfer of this money to you as the of kin.  
The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of  
70% for me and 30% for you. 
 
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this will be  
done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager  
the execution of this If you are  
please reply via the private email address  
below. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details  
and relevant documents that will help you the 
 
Please observe utmost and be rest assured that this  
would be most for both of us because I shall  
require your to invest my share in your country.

Mr. Donga Kabaka. 
P. O. Box 241. Sharjah, United Arab Emirate UAE 

Dear Sir/Madam 
 
You may be surprised to receive this letter from me 
since you do not know me For the purpose 
of I am Mr. Donga Kabaka, the son of Dr. 
James Kabaka, a wealthy black in 
Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my 
country. 
 
The land problem, in our country came when our 
President Mr. Robert Mugabe in a bid to win his 
a new Land Act Reform wholly 
affecting the rich white farmers and the black farmers 
who are members of the (MDC) party. This 
resulted in killings and mob action by war 
veterans and some lunatics in the society. It is 
against this that I and my immediate family 
had fled Harare our capital for fear of our lives and 
are currently staying in a country side of 
United Arab Emirate. We are planning to leave 
the country and seek political asylum in Europe and we 
have decided to move our family wealth to Europe. 
 
We got your contact through the Internet based on our 
urgent need for a and foreign 
partner and hence decided to write to you. Before the 
death of my late father, he had taken me to 
United Aram Emirate several times and had 
deposited the total sum of US$20.5 million (Twenty 
million, Five Hundred thousand United States dollars), 
in one of the private security as he 
foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was 
deposited in two boxes as Family Treasures to avoid 
much demurrage from the security company. This amount 
was meant for the purchase of new machines and 
chemicals for the Farms and the of new 
farms in 
 
As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the 
of seeking a genuine partner that could 
assist us without the knowledge of my who 
are bent on taking we have got, and the 
United Arab Emirate seems to be playing along 
with them. I am faced with the dilemma of moving this 
amount of money out of United Arab Emirate for fear of going 
through the same in future. 
 
We are seeking a partner whom I have to entrust my 
future and that of my family in his/her hands. To this 
end, we need your to stand as the 
of the in Europe. This is 
because we are under movement and watch and 
hence we want to be very careful in order not to lose 
this fund, which we have worked so hard for. I have a 
CONTACT person at the Security Company in 
United Arab Emirate who can help us move this money to Europe 
under COVER to another Security Company in 
Europe with your details as the This is 
100% legal and will not pass through normal 

Thus, if you are willing to assist us to move this 
fund out of UAE, you can contact me through 
my email address with your fax number and 
personal to enable us discuss further 
details. I must let you know that this is 
risk free as far as we keep it as as 
possible. Thank you and many blessings to you. 
 
Yours 
 
Mr. Donga Kabaka.

Dear Sir, 
 
I got your esteemed address from the internet during my search for a 
reliable who can jointly handle strictly 
with me which involves a sum of money. 
 
Due to the nature of this business a neutral person like you is 
For purpose, I am JAMES Momodu Pujeh, The son of 
Momdu Pujeh, former transport and minister in Sierra Leone 
who has been recently convicted for two years for illegally 
638.81 carats of diamonds valued at $36,500. 
 
My father was sacked in November 2001 after the 
alleged that he and my mother had been involved in diamond in 
Kenema, in the eastern part of Sierra Leone. My father won a seat in 
elections held last year but is expected to resign following 
his My mother, Mary Momodu, is under on a similar = 
charges. 
 
You may have heard how a lot of my father's bank account in and 
North America has been frozen. Following the outlined reasons for 
I am for your esteemed 
to take custody of Thirteen Million, five hundred thousand United 
States Dollars and also to front for my family in the 
areas of business you consider 
 
These the funds have secretly been concealed and 
deposited with a Security firm where it can easily be taken 
delivery of by a The the 
funds will be released to your 
by the Security firm based on my on that note; 
you will be presented as our partner who will be fronting for me and my 
family in any ventures. 
 
I have made my first visit to the security company and the document entitled 
to clear this money is with a finance security company in Holland. On our 
arrival in the few weeks ago, we sought for political asylum; 
which was granted. 
 
Already, my sister and I are making frantic effort on the best way to handle 
this money. We sought advice from an attorney who advised that we must seek 
for a foreign business partner whom can invest this fund in a 
venture. 
 
This we view as the best option because our refugee status dose not permit 
us to operate a bank account, hence we seek your and hope you 
could be trusted. 
I sincerely ask for your to get this money through 
your account. I and my mother have decided to give 25% to your 
if you are able to help us claim this And 5% will be use for 
upsetting all the expenses incurred in the course of this venture 
and the remaining 70% that will be for me and my family. 
 
Please, I need your entire support and for the success of this 
business ventures, your utmost and secrecy is highly 
required, due to my family's present Also you stand to gain 
from any you might introduce us into after the of the 
transfer. Please keep this until we finalize and get this money 
into your account for security reasons. 
 
I am presently in the refugee camp here in the under the United 
Nations and I can be reached by to the following email address: 

Kind regards,

severe state and my doctor has told me this. My late 
husband was killed during the Gulf war, and during the 
period of our marriage we had a son who was also 
killed in cold blood during the Gulf war.  
 
My late husband was very wealthy and after his death,I 
inherited all his business and wealth. As my doctor 
told me that I may not live for more than six months,I 
am so scared about this. So, I now decided to divide 
part of the inherited wealth, by to the 
of in part of the world.  
This mission which will no doubt be tasking had made 
me to recently relocated to Nigeria, Africa where I 
live I selected your ministry after 
visiting the website for this purpose and prayed over 
it, I am willing to donate the sum of 
Million USD)to your Ministry for

I am Mr.George Akin,from Arab Bank Plc,Benin Rep. During the  
course of our auditing we the sum of  
floating in an account opened in this Bank since 1999 and as  
from 2001 nobody has operated on this account again, and after  
going through some old files in the records I that  
the owner of the account died without a 11th 2001  
by plane crash, hence the money is floating. 
 
After due I noticed that no other person knows  
about this account except his wife who was also invovled in the  
crash, and the account has no other and my  
proved to me as well that until his death he was  
the Director GOLD ARK [SARL] 
  
Since our Bank Arab Bank Plc Benin rep. got about  
his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come  
forward and claim his money because we cannot release it unless  
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the  
deceased as indicated in our banking and policies  
but up to date nobody came up to this bank as his next of kin  
or relative. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and  
other officials in my now decided to make this  
businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the  
next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and  
since nobody is coming forth and we  
don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed  
Bill. 
  
On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used  
as the next of kin as no one has come up as his relation. And  
the country law here does not allow such money to stay more  
than Five years, for the money will be recalled to the  
treasury as unclaimed after this period. 
Upon the receipt of your response, I will send to you the  
form, bank's contact and the next step to take. I  
will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is  
hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all  
for fund transfer can be finalized within five  
banking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the  
deceased. 
  
When you receive this letter, kindly send me an e-mail  
your your private Tel/Fax numbers  
for quick I will be very happy if you can treat  
this business with the utmost secrecy it demands because of my  
position in this bank. 
 
Hoping for a very business with you. 

Mr George Akin.

: Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha. 
 
I am Mrs. Agnes Fatima Isa Kiatha, from Kuwait. I am married to  
Usman Isa Kaitha of blessed  
memory who worked with Kuwait embassy in Madrid Spain for nine  
years before he died in the year  
2002. We were married for eleven years without a child he died  
after a brief illness that lasted  
only four days. Before his death he was a very devoted Muslim and  
I was a devoted Christian by  
birth battling with both cancer and fibroid problems. When my  
late husband was alive, he  
deposited the sum of dollars (twenty five million,  
five hundred dollars), which he in 
herited from his late father (sheikh Usman Isa Kaitha) with an  
overseas finance and security firm.  
this money is still with finance and security firm.  
Recently, my doctor told me that I  
had a illness (cancer) that would last for the next  
four months.  
 
Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either  
a Christian or a  
devoted Christian that will utilize this money the way  
I am going to instruct here in. 
   
I want this Christian or to use this  
money in all sincerity to fund  
churches, widows and also the word of God  
and to ensure that the society  
upholds the views and beliefs of the holy bible. The holy bible  
so much on the giving  
of alms, charity and this has me in taking this bold  
step. I took this decision  
because I don't have any child and my late husband's relatives  
are all Muslims and I don't want  
my hard earned money to be misused by people that call  
me an 
 
I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an  
unholy manner hence the reasons for  
taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with  
God the highest and the most  
merciful one. I don't need any telephone but will  
only give you the contact of my  
lawyer because he is the one who is going to assist you in making  
you the of the  
in the finance and security firm if you receive this  
letter and accept to assist me  
to conclude this if you want to speak with me he  
will arrange for that because my  
doctor warned me not to talk for too long a time and secondly, I  
can't discuss in the presence of 
my husbands relatives for they always stay with me in the  
hospital, my lawyer is the only person  
that knows the decision that I am taking. 
 
With God, I know that all things are possible and as soon as I  
receive your reply through my  
lawyer I will now give him to make you the  
of the and all  
necessary steps to take before receiving these funds and I shall  
also give you the contact of the 
finance and security firm I will also issue you a letter of  
authority that will prove you as the  
original of the funds. I want you and the Christian  
community where you reside to  
always pray for me.  
 
My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted Christian  
though married to a Muslim,  
whoever that wants to serve God must serve him in truth and in  
spirit, please always be prayerful  
all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room  
in souring for another Christian 
or a devoted Christian for the same purpose.  
 
Until I hear from you my dreams will rest squarely on your  
may the Almighty God  
continue to guide and protect you. Amen.

 Lagos, Nigeria. 
 Phone: 
 
 Sir, 
  
 of the day and how is life general with 
 you? Of course it is my humble wish to solicit and 
 crave your to make this project request 
 for 
 a joint business which I hope will not 
 come to you as a surprise, hence I plead for your 
 pardon.   
 I am Mike Igbo, the manager of first 
 bank 
 of Nig. Plc. Lagos. I have an urgent and 
 
 business proposal for you.  
  
 On June 6, 1997, an oil 
 with via National Petroleum 
 (NNPC) Mr. Peter Bush made a numbered 
 time 
 (fixed) deposit for twelve month valued 
 at 
 000. Million US Dollars) 
 in 
 my branch. 
  
 On maturity, I sent a routine to his 
 forwarded address but got no reply after months we 
 send a reminder and finally we from his 
 contract employee (Nigeria national petroleum 
 that Mr. Peter Bush died from an 
 accident. On further it 
 was 
 clear that he died without making a will. All 
 attempts by the to trace his next of kin 
 were 
  
 I therefore made further and 
 
 that Mr. Peter Bush did not declare any next of kin 
 or 
 relations in all his official documents including 
 his 
 deposit document in my bank. The total sum 
 is still in my bank as dormant 
 acct. 
 No one will ever come forward to claim it. According 
 to Nigerian banking law, after five years, the money 
 will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian 
 If the account owner is certified death 
 and nobody comes forward to claim it. 
  
 This is the and my proposal is that I am 
 looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the 
 of kin. This is simple. All you 
 have 
 to do is to send me the details of a 
 bank 
 account anywhere in the world for me to arrange the 
 proper money transfer document. The money will then 
 be 
 into the account for us to share in the 
 ration of 60% for me 30% for you while the remaining 
 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred with 
 here 
 and there. 
  
 There is no risk involved. I am using my position 
 and 
 in the bank here to do all the document 
 work for the We shall employ the 
 services 
 of an attorney to draft the will and obtain all 
 necessary documents and letter of in 
 your favor for the transfer. This is 
 risk 
 free If you are please reply 
 and be rest assured that 
 this could be most for both 
 of 
 us. Please do not expose this deal if you are not 
 because if you do, it will take me out of 
 seat. 
  
 I am awaiting your urgent reply. 
  
 Best regards, 
  
  Mike Igbo.

Dear  Friend, 
 
I presume this letter will come to you as a surprise, but 
as 
things unfold, we will know each other better. I will start 
by 
myself to you. 
 
I am Mrs. Rose Obaseki, the wife of Chief Jackson Gracious 
Obaseki, the Managing Director, and Chief 
Nigerian National 
Petroleum (NNPC). I am really sure that you 
will be of a 
good after going through this letter. 
For many years of marriage now between me and my husband, I 
have 
not given birth, and this has really troubled my husband. 
As a result  
of the respect given to local tradition culture and custom 
here in  
husband has decided to break the marriage. With 
the situation of things 
with me now, my home look bleak. I am been 
daily 
by my husband to get out from the home. My Husband s 
brothers are not 
left outin this matter.  
 
This situation has really affected me 
As at now, I am no longer Assured of a home, 
hence I seek 
your urgent and help which I know will go a long 
way in getting  
me settled finally. 
 
I want to use this to move the sum of 
into 
your custody for safe keeping, pending my arrival in your 
country. This 
said amount was given to my husband as from 
some Foreign Oil 
Companies he helped in getting for the Drilling 
of Crude Oil 
in Nigeria. 
 
As a civil servant, he does not want to be exposed, hence 
he 
gave me this money to keep in my personal account so that 
he can be 
from the eyes of security 
and the  
Civil Service (CSC) which is a body that 
the of all 
civil servants in Nigeria as checks and balances for 
official 
Be informed that this money is not connected 
with drugs; money laundry, 
firearms and looting which I believe will put fears in you 
to render the  
required needed from you and 
your help for 
security reasons. 
 
Hence the source of this said money is clean and clear. 
This money was deposited in my name, and 
there is no way it can be under 
the banking 
which could have been the easiest, but because 
of monetary 
transfer by the Federal of Nigeria, 
that is 
defeated. Rather I have arranged a diplomat manager to move 
this money out in cash to any 
where it will be easy for you to collect under 

immunity. 
 
This he has assured me of. As a soon as I see your response 
and 
to help as regards to this, I will furnish you 
on the next line of 
acti onto take, but be rest assured that this 
is 100% risk free, 
and my husband will not raise any alarm because he will not 
like to put 
himself, his job and office in jeopardy, and if he does, he 
stands the 
change of loosing his job. 
 
As soon as this money is moved to you, and you confirm to 
me 
that you have received it, I will be coming to meet you up 
there in  
your country where I wish to live the rest of my life. I 
will be offering  
you 25% of this money for all your help at this time of 
need, while some 
has been  set aside for my Brother to 
his efforts here. Be 
informed that this will not last more than 14 
working days 
and it will be concluded because every has been 
put in place. 
Your negative or positive response will be highly 

Yours 
 
Mrs. Rose Obaseki

     PLEASE REPLY TO  
 
Good day and a happy and new year ! 
 
I am Kolapo Omidire, company secretary and manager, 
internal and external services of BANK OF 
AFRICA. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my 
bank who perished with his entire family  
(His wife and only son) in a plane crash (Korean Air Line 
801) on August 6, 1997. 
 
Since the demise of this customer of ours , the bank 
of BANK OF AFRICA has made valuable 
efforts to get in touch with any of the late 
or relative anywhere in the world but  
all our efforts did not yield any positive 
results as no one has come to claim his funds to the tune 
of Twenty one million, five hundred thousand united states 
which has been with my bank all these 
while. 
 
Recently, the Federal of Nigeria directed that 
all funds not claimed (which has exceeded the 
banking period of seven years for such money) should be 
to the Federal Treasury Because 
the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay 
more than seven means that this money will be 
recalled to the federal treasury as unclaimed 
after this period, precisely within this first quater  
of this year. 
 
On this note, the chairman of the board of directors of the 
bank recently called me and told me in and trust 
to source for a reliable foreigner who would stand as our 
foreign next of kin. We (myself 
and the chairman) have reasoned that if we fail to collect 
this money the Nigerian will it and 
someone else will end up looting it. Thats's why we have 
decided to contact you, hoping you will prove to 
be a reliable foreigner to stand as next of Kin to the 
deceased customer to claim the total fund from his account 
with the bank so that the proceeds of his account can be 
paid to you. 
 
Be assured that this is risk free and we will 
do all possible to give it the legal and backing

Attn my friend,  
 
With due respect and huminity I propose this to you. I  
wrote to you last  
time no response and I decided to write you again.  
 
I am Mr.Nze Moore from Arab Bank Plc,Benin Rep. During the  
course of our  
auditing we the sum of floating in an  
account opened  
in this Bank since 1996 and as from 1999 nobody has  
operated on this account  
again, and after going through some old files in the  
records I  
that the owner of the account died without a [HEIRE] on oct  
31 1999 by  
plane crash, Egyptair flight 990,  
the  
money is  
floating.  
After due I noticed that no other person knows  
about this  
account except his wife who  
was also invovled in the crash, and the account has no  
other and  
my proved to me as well that until his death  
he was the  
Director GOLD ARK [SARL]  
 
Since our Bank Arab Bank Plc Benin rep. got  
about his death, we  
have been expecting his next of kin to come forward and  
claim his money  
because we cannot release it unless somebody  
applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased  
as indicated in  
our banking and policies but up to date nobody  
came up to this  
bank as his next of kin or relative. It is therefore upon  
this discovery  
that I and other officials in my now decided to  
make this  
businness proposal to you and release the money to you as  
the next of kin or  
relation to the deceased for safety and  
since nobody  
is coming forth and we don't want this money to go into the  
Bank treasury as  
unclaimed Bill.  
 
On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be  
used as the next  
of kin as no one has come up as his relation. And the  
country law here does  
not allow such money to stay more than Five years, for the  
money will be  
recalled to the treasury as unclaimed after this  
period.  
Upon the receipt of your response, I will send to you the  
form,  
bank's contact and the next step to take. I will not fail  
to bring to your  
notice that this business is hitch free and that you should  
not  
entertain any fear as all for fund transfer can  
be finalized  
within five banking days, after you apply to the bank as a  
relation to the  
deceased.  
 
When you receive this letter, kindly send me an e-mail  
your  
your private  
Tel/Fax numbers for quick I will be very  
happy if you can  
treat this business with the  
utmost secrecy it demands because of my position in this  
bank.  
Hoping for a very business with  
you.  
 
Mr Nze Moore.

late husband was alive, he  
deposited the sum of dollars (twenty five million,  
five hundred dollars), which he in 
herited from his late father (sheikh Usman Isa Kaitha) with an  
overseas finance and security firm.  
this money is still with finance and security firm.  
Recently, my doctor told me that I  
had a illness (cancer) that would last for the next  
four months.  
 
Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either  
a Christian or a  
devoted Christian that will utilize this money the way  
I am going to instruct here in. 
   
I want this Christian or to use this  
money in all sincerity to fund  
churches, widows and also the word of God  
and to ensure that the society  
upholds the views and beliefs of the holy bible. The holy bible  
so much on the giving  
of alms, charity and this has me in taking this bold  
step. I took this decision  
because I don't have any child and my late husband's relatives  
are all Muslims and I don't want  
my hard earned money to be misused by people that call  
me an 
 
I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an  
unholy manner hence the reasons for  
taking this bold decision. I know that after death I will be with  
God the highest and the most  
merciful one. I don't need any telephone but will  
only give you the contact of my  
lawyer because he is the one who is going to assist you in making  
you the of the  
in the finance and security firm if you receive this  
letter and accept to assist me  
to conclude this if you want to speak with me he  
will arrange for that because my  
doctor warned me not to talk for too long a time and secondly, I  
can't discuss in the presence of 
my husbands relatives for they always stay with me in the  
hospital, my lawyer is the only person  
that knows the decision that I am taking. 
 
With God, I know that all things are possible and as soon as I  
receive your reply through my  
lawyer I will now give him to make you the  
of the and all  
necessary steps to take before receiving these funds and I shall  
also give you the contact of the 
finance and security firm I will also issue you a letter of  
authority that will prove you as the  
original of the funds. I want you and the Christian  
community where you reside to  
always pray for me.  
 
My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted Christian  
though married to a Muslim,  
whoever that wants to serve God must serve him in truth and in  
spirit, please always be prayerful  
all through your life. Any delay in your reply will give me room  
in souring for another Christian 
or a devoted Christian for the same purpose.  
 
Until I hear from you my dreams will rest squarely on your  
may the Almighty God  
continue to guide and protect you. Amen.  
 
Yours

After the death of my husband, my children and I decided to move out of Zimbabwe because our lives were in danger with the fund that my husband kept in his hidden safe in my house. The amount contained in the safe is US$30,5 Million (Thirty Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) and we decided to move this money to the Republic of South Africa, where we deposited it with a private  Security Company as a valuables in a This I did for security reasons and to keep from public eyes.I have two options, firstly you can choose to have certain of the money for your account for this or you can go into with me for proper of the money in your the option you want, feel free to notify me.

.E. O 
With due respect trust and humility, I write you this proposal, which I believe will be a great interest to you. I found your contact while I was doing a private research on the Internet for a reliable and capable foreign partner that will assist my family and I. That's why I contacted you. 
I am Prince Charles Zuma the first son of Late Mr.Morris Zuma who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I found your contact while I was doing a private research on the Internet for a reliable and capable foreign partner that will assist my family in a business hence I decided to write to you. 
Before the death of my father, he had taken me to to Deposit the sum of US$29 M (Twenty Nine Million United States Dollars). in a private security company, as if he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money was deposited in a box as Precious Metals to avoid any suspicion from the security company. 
This amount was meant for the purchase of new and chemicals and of a new farm in This land problem came up when Zimbabwe President Mr. Robert Mugabe a New Land Act reform, which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some few Black farmers. 
This resulted to killings and mob action by war veterans in the society. In fact, a lot of people were killed because of this land reform act for which my father is a victim. It is against this that my family and I who are currently staying in South Africa decided to transfer my father's money to a foreign Country since the law of South Africa prohibits refugees to transact any business with the bank. 
As the eldest son of my father, I am given the of seeking a genuine foreign partner who will provide a foreign account where this money could be into as soon as possible for the of my family. I must also let you know that this is 100% risk free. If you accept to assist my family and me. All I want from you is for you to make and come to Africa so that you can open a account in your name which will aid us in this money into any account you will nominate overseas. 
I have two options, firstly you can choose to have certain of the money for your account for this or you can go into with me for proper of the money in your the option you want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses that might be incured in the process of this 
If you do not prefer a I am willing to give you 20% of the total money, while 75% will be for my family and me. If you are really capable and willing to assist me, please contact me on the above telephone or by email. Finally, please treat this matter as urgent and I intend to leave this country soonest. 
Thanks for your mutual I expect your urgent response.

Dear Sir, 
 
My name is Hartman Onowu,I am the manager 
in account section incharge of credit and 
foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in South 
Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer 
of my bank who perished with his whole families on 
25TH JULY,2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [ Flight AF4590 ] 
with the whole aboard. 
 
There is an account opened in this bank in 1998 by 
this great late who died without a 
written or oral WILL attatched to the account. Since 
his death , I has watched with keen 
interest to see the next of kin but all has proved 
abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and no 
other person knows about this account or anything 
it,the account has no other and 
until his death he was the manager of his company. 
 
The total amount involved is 
Million United States Dollar ]. We wish 
to start the first transfer with 
million] and open without any 
from your side, we shall re-apply for 
the transfer of the remaining balance to your account. 
I have secretly discussed this matter with the general 
manager of the bank who I must involve in order to 
have a smooth and a transfer of the fund to 
any foreign bank account which you are going to 
nominate. On this note, I decided to seek for a 
reliable foreigner who will act as the foreign 
of the fund from the deceased by providing 
his/her bank account where the fund will be 
for immediate on any viable 
project as no one has come up to be the next of kin. 
 
The banking ethics here does not allow such money to 
stay more than six years without claim hence the money 
will be recalled to the treasury as 
unclaimed after this long period of domancy. In view 
of this I got your contact through my personal search 
to see if you can assist by providing your safe bank 
account for the transfer or find a reliable person who 
will be capable of receiving such amount in his or her 
personal account. 
 
At the of the transfer 65% of the fund 
will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total 
transfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in 
your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside 
to settle expenses both parties might incure during 
the transfer process. Upon the receipt of your reply, 
I will send to you a detailed about the 
will not fail to bring to your notice 
that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and 
that you should not entertain any fear as all 
for fund transfer can be finalized within 7 
to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as the 
of the fund from the deceased. 
 
When you receive this letter, Kindly send me an e-mail 
or you can call me or fax me. You should also include 
your private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe 

yours, 
Hartman Onowu.

From: Mrs. Susan 
<br> 
Greetings to you,<br> 
<br> 
With warm heart I offer my and 
and I hope this mail meets you in good time. 
strange or this contact might seem to you<br> 
as we have not met or had any dealings in<br> 
the past, I humbly ask that you take due 
of its and the immense benefit it will be<br> 
to you.<br> 
<br> 
After careful with my children, we<br> 
resolved to contact you for your most 
in this manner. I duly apologize <br> 
for on your privacy, if this contact is not<br> 
to you, as I make this proposal to you as a<br> 
person of 
<br> 
First and foremost I wish to introduce myself 
to you. My name is Mrs. Susan Shabangu, mother of<br> 
three and the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy <br> 
of The Republic of South Africa for seven years <br> 
running as you will find in the link <br> 
below: <br> 
<br> 
 <br> 
I will now give you a general overview of the<br> 
When I was sworn in as Deputy Minister of<br> 
Minerals and Energy in 1996, with my my<br> 
husband Mr. Ndelebe Simon Shabangu a very 
was awarded several contracts in my<br> 
ministry and had direct dealings with 
investors in this field. Due to my 
status, I was not involved in my husbands 
which was very vast and My beloved 
died whilst on an official trip to Trinidad <br> 
and Tobago in February 2001.<br> 
<br> 
When my husband died, I was contacted as next of kin<br> 
by a private security firm in Europe to come forth<br> 
with the of Deposit and claim a 
deposit my husband has in their Vault in his name. At <br> 
that time, my children and I did not have an idea<br> 
where the might be. We then the<br> 
security firm to continue holding the safety 
until further from me. Whilst 
for the second of my beloved husband, I<br> 
was going through his library and to my<br> 
I a <br> 
of Deposit for the safety deposit with this 
security firm, and other documents relating to the<br> 
safety deposit in a book. The safety 
which is a trunk, is stocked with hard currency (US<br> 
Dollars) totalling which was 
from cash payments from his business in the<br> 
diamond trade from Antwerp, 
<br> 
Though I knew my late husband was in the 
business, I did not have the knowledge that he moved<br> 
funds in cash. This has came as a shock to me and my<br> 
children, and we have decided to have this fund<br> 
invested in and 
abroad as well as ventures, as<br> 
any member of my family cannot hold such a huge<br> 
amount in our name due to my political status, hence<br> 
we sincerely propose to you to render us your most<br> 
needed in this 
<br> 
If you agree to render us your your role<br> 
in this project will be to act on my behalf as a<br> 
trustee to receive the safety deposit the<br> 
funds from the Security firm. Though I believe this<br> 
should be based on my 
interest will be protected by a family who<br> 
is a attached to the South<br> 
African Embassy in the country where the security firm<br> 
is located. He is now aware of the safety deposit, and<br> 
I have informed him that I am locating one of my<br> 
husband's business (you) to handle the<br> 
funds and invest on our behalf, as he might be 
to our decision if he found out <br> 
that I barely know you.<br> 
<br> 
For your reliable we are offering you 20<br> 
% of the funds. I thank you in advance as<br> 
we your in enabling us<br> 
achieve this goal. On hearing from you, I will 
your contact to the gentleman lawyer who will be<br> 
us, and also give you his<br> 
contact for both of you to and 
with the <br> 
<br> 
He will be working with you for a mutual of<br> 
the process and I look forward to a long 
business with you. As you may <br> 
due to my sensitive position in the<br> 
present it is not safe to with<br> 
me via phone or fax. <br> 
<br> 
This is why I have with you with my<br> 
private email address, and I like us to keep this way,<br> 
for the safety of this 
<br> 
whether or not you are in assisting us <br>

companies that actually executed these contracts have been  
 
fully paid and the projects

total amount to your account for  
 
since we as civil servants are by the code of  
 
conduct bureau (civil service law) from operating and/or  
 
opening foreign accounts in our names.  
Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this is  
 
enormous, in return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the

Once more I want you to that having put in over  
 
twenty five years in the civil service of my country, I am

Dear Sir, 
My name is Mohammed Hamid, I am from Iraq. My cousin was a top officer in the former of Sadam Hussein. Before the beginning of the war he gave me (Seventy Five Million United States Dollars) to keep for him. 
I managed to move the box the money out of Iraq through immunity to a Security company in London , U.K  and the box is been deposited as family treasure, for security reasons. Now that the war is over I want to move the money to your country for safety reasons. Be rest assured that this is risk free as no person is aware of this money.  
You will be with 25% of the total sum, if you can assist. Expecting your urgent reply via   . 
Yours

Visit, 
 
Now my father has accepted to quit power and leave 
Liberia on the arrival of force which 
might be headed by American troops. But the delay in 
deploying peace keeping force has worsened situation in 
the country. In spite of this, my country Liberia is 
like a herd of cattle without shepherd.  
 
The rebel who see my family as a threat to 
their are planning to kill 
every one of us when capture. 
 
However, I am a young man who has ambitions and I am

secretly left Liberia for Amsterdam to seek asylum.

himself and I deposited a huge amount of money in a 
security vault overseas on my name. The 
funds were arranged into a before 
deposited with the security company but, the security 
company did not know that the contains 
money. Because, the was declared to 
contain family treasure and 
 
The fact that the I remain in the Asylum camp and we continue to 
huge debts daily as long as the 
remains in the security vault, made me 
decided to get someone reliable to proceed as soon as 
possible to receive these funds 
for purpose. As a young man, I plan to use 
this money to safeguard my future. 
 
It is very essential that you the kind of 
trust and I want to put in you. This is an 
act of on my part, in order not to loose 
this money incase of any For your 
reliable if willing, I will reward you 
with 25% of the money. 
 
As soon as you declare your to assist, i 
shall furnish you with the details and you 
will need to this task. Please, be rest 
assured that this is risk free 
And cannot implicate you in any way. However, I 
implore you to handle this matter with urgency, utmost 
secrecy and for security and safety 
reasons, even if you do not intend to execute the 
project.

I therefore made further and that Mr. Richard Moss did not declare any kin or relations in all his official including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.
